## The Structure of This Presentation
### Part 1
- Quiz Show

### Part 2
- Normal Presentation

::: {.notes}

This talk will be split into two sections. Half of it will be a quiz show, and the other half will be a normal, serious, presentation.

:::

## The Structure of This Presentation
### Part 1: Quiz Show
- Motivation
  - The need for uncertainty visualisations
  - The need for a new taxonomy
- Chapter 1
  - Details of the taxonomy 

::: {.notes}

The first section will be the work in the first chapter of my PhD. It will be in the form of a quiz show where my research over the past year will be fed to you as explanations or preamble to a quiz question.

:::

## The Structure of This Presentation
### Part 2: Serious Presentation
- The Rest of the PhD
  - Chapter 2 & 3
  - Additional work
  - Timeline
  
::: {.notes}

The second section will be an explanation of the work I plan to do for the rest of my PhD, some comments on additional work I did and a timeline for the next few years. This section will not be a quiz show and will just be a normal presentation. Feel free to interrupt at any point with questions, either about the content itself or clarifying questions for the quiz. So if nobody has any questions about the structure...

# Are You Smarter Than A Big 4 Consultant?

::: {.notes}

... lets get quizzing. One of my housemates works at EY as a consultant. She has very little statistics knowledge. She *did* take introduction to econometrics several years ago, however she failled the exam. During this presentation you will have to answer 10 multiple choice questions where you extract some information from a data visualisation. Your goal as a group is to perform better than the average score for the consultants.

One of the reasons data visualisation authors dont present uncertainty is because they believe laypeople, not educated in the ways of statistics cannot understand the it. You will all have a chance to see if that bias is correct or not. If a group a academics in statistics can outperform a group of consultants.

Lets get started by talking about the importance of visualisation. This is a plot of the famous data set, Anscombe's quartet. This data set highlights the importance of visualising your data. Since all 4 plots have the same mean, correlation and standard deviation, they appear identical when you use summary statistics to extract interesting information. 
:::

## Importance of Visualisation
- Sketching distribution = better predictions ^[@Hullman2018; @Goldstein2014]
- Interactive graphics = better understanding ^[@Potter2009; @Ancker2009]
- Infographics = more accessible ^[@Ancker2009]

::: {.notes}
Even something as simple as sketching a distribution before recalling statistics or making predictions can greatly increase the accuracy of those measures.  Additionally, since visualisations allow for interactive graphics they provide a more in depth understanding of probability and are more accessible, since infographics can be understood by people with poor numeracy skills. 

Now, the importance of visualisation is well established but an implicit understanding that we bring with illustrations like this, is that the visualsiation has to be done well.

Now for your first question. We often don't know the best way to visualise a distribution, nor do we know which variables should go togehter. On the slide I have four data visualisations. Three of them were made using the Anscombe's quartet data, one was made with fake data. In the fake data set each variable was a random sample of observations from the original data set, to make sure the values were still somewhat within the same range. Your first question is, which one of the four plots on this page was not made using Anscombe's quartet data?

The take away from this question is not that you should be able to identify the Anscombe's quartet data no matter how it is presented, but rather that the presentation matters. None of the visualisations shown here identified the interesting features I displayed in the previous slide. These visualisations have the same problem as the numerical summary, because despite being visualisations, they displayed the wrong information. What is rarely discussed about Anscombe's quartet is that we already know the best way to display it to show the important information. Thinking about visualisations this way forces us to ask ourselves what we consider to be the important features of our data, which lead me to my next question.

## Questions 2 & 3
### Decision Making Under Uncertainty
:::

::: {.notes}
Our second and third quiz questions, will focus on the importance of uncertainty in decision making.
:::


## ...Is uncertainty important information?
- Only 1/4  of visualisation authors show uncertainty in 50% or more of their graphics. ^[@Hullman2020a]
- Reasons include:
  - overwhelm the audience
  - inability to calculate
  - a lack of information 
  - not wanting to make their data seem questionable
  



::: {.notes}
Is uncertainty important information? This isn't a quiz question its rhetorical. The amount we actually visualise uncertainty would lead to believe it isn't. A survey of visualisations authors shows that only a quarter of them included uncertainty in 50% or more of their visualisations. The reasoning provided is things like a fear of overwhelming the audience, an inability to calculate the uncertainty, not having access to the uncertainty information, not wanting people to ask them about their results, etc.

When we talk about uncertainty, we usually mean the sampling distribution for some estimate. There is an underlying belief in all the reasons provided by visualsiation authors that uncertainty is of secondary importance to our estimates. This comes through in the colloquial ways we talk about uncertainty. We call uncertainty the noise and the estimate the signal. It implies that uncertainty is something we should brush away to find some truth, as though the uncertainty information is not of importance by itself. 

The next two quiz questions are going to test that hypothesis.

When is the best time to arrive at the tram stop? There are 6 options on the slide. I can go back to the previous slide if you want, but the utility points should not be considered that deeply, they mostly exist to highlight that there is a correct answer. I recommend you just take a guess and try to answer this question by thinking about when you would actually arrive at the tram stop.

## Solution
The best time to arrive is at time B

While there is some research that the general public cannot understand complicated concepts in statistics across the board, presenting uncertainty information improves decision making both experimentally and in practice.

As a matter of fact, doing what many authors currently do causes decision makers to have completely unbounded expectations on an outcome.

## Question 4 
### Current Graphics Categories
:::

::: {.notes}
So I have established the importance of providing a good visualsiation as well as the importance of expressing uncertainty, but what is a good uncertainty visualsiation. I mean what is a visualisation of uncertainty. Why don't you guys try and figure it out.
:::


## Alternative Taxonomy
::: {fig-align="center"}
<iframe width="1200" height="600" src="https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/directory-of-visualizations.html"></iframe>
:::

::: {.notes}
There are quite a few taxonomies or organisation systems for visualisations. Here is an example of one, it is from the Fundamentals of Data Visualization book and it organises visualisations into the 7 categories: amounts, distributions, proportions, x-y relationships, geospatial data, and uncertainty. There are many other organisation methods, but they all suffer from the same problem. They don't think too deeply about the statistics that made these visualisations. You will better understand what I mean if you experience this yourself.
:::

## Question 4: Apply the Alternative Taxonomy
Which of these plots are uncertainty visualisations?

![](6dists.jpeg){fig-align="center" width=80%}

:::{ .notes}
Since we have the category of "uncertainty visualisation" some plots must belong to that group, while others don't. If that was not the case, why even discuss "uncertainty visualisation" as it's own topic. So, your 4th quiz question is "which of these plots are uncertainty visualisations? 
:::

## Solution
They all are.


![](6dists.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

[Results](https://flux.qa/#/presentations/64805896ff94fa54629cd870/6480588eff94fa54629cd86e?tab=polls&poll=64882dc7ff94fa54629cf56a){preview-link="true"}


::: {.notes}
They all are. All the plots shown in the previous slide are by some paper or another considered an uncertainty visualisation. Is it anything that implies our values are not deterministic? Looking at a scatter plot gives us an idea of mass, something that the eye plot also does. A boxplot doesn't give a good idea of mass but it does highlight several thresholds, something that an error bar does which we do generally consider to be an uncertainty distribution. A bar chart and a choropleth map can both be consider an outcome of a sample similarly but also we can consider uncertainty by changing our colour thresholds or expresisng a probability as an estimate. There is no such thing as an uncertainty visualisation.
:::

## What's an "Uncertainty Visualisation"

![](scribblemess.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

:::{ .notes}
If there is no such thing as an uncertainty visualisation, how do we visualise uncertainty? Is it an expression of multiple values, or a threshold, or of a variance? Something that allows us to identify a distribution? A sample of our data or a collection of esitmates?

There isn't really an answer for this. Specific visualisations don't *need* to depict certain pieces of information and with combinations of aesthetic features and distributions and dependencies, you can't organise the current collection of plots in any meaningful way. There is no way to find gaps in our current visualisation literature if we don't even know what our current visualisation methods cover. We need to have a better language to discuss the information a plot displays. 
:::

::: {style="text-align: center; margin-top: 6em"}
## When comparing visual features, remember...
. . . 

### ...plots can only be compared if they contain the same information.^[@Cleveland1984]
:::

::: {.notes}
Identifying gaps in the current visualisation methods isn't the only reason we need a taxonomy, there is a second, more meta, reason it's needed. In order to compare plots, they need to contain the same information. Otherwise, we cannot be sure if one plot outperforms the other because of a gap in the information or a difference in the way that information is displayed. Papers that compare plots that have wildly different information are everywhere in the infoviz literature because once you go beyond expressing a single value, what we define as information becomes complicated. A unified language around what information is contained in a plot will allow us to more easily recognise which plots are appropriate to compare.

## A Taxonomy for Visualisation Information
### (Questions 5 to 8) 
:::

:::{ .notes}
So, without further ado, lets dive into the taxonomy. 
:::

## The Three Elements of the Taxonomy

![](3elements.jpeg){fig-align="center" width=60%}

::: {.notes}
There are three features of a visualisation that we should consider when we want to understand the information it conveys. First, you need to ask yourself what distribution your plot depicts and if it is the best distribution for the questions we want to answer. Second you need to ask what features of that distribution are depicted and if those features convey the information we want. Finally you need to consider the hierarchy we implicitly give to those features, and ask if we are drawing attention to the information we think is important.
:::

::: {style="text-align: center; margin-top: 6em"}
## Questions 5 & 6

- The plot on the left shows two independent distributions of student heights from two primary school classes, class A and B, that are obsessed with competing with each other. 
- Most recently they have started competing on heights.
- The game works like this, two students are randomly selected from each class every day and the taller student wins a point for their class
- They will play this game for 100 days and
- The winning class gets a pizza party
- That isn't relevant to the statistics I'm just trying to paint a beautiful story
- On how many of the days do we expect class A to win?

## The All Knowing Marginal Distribution
![](incorrectdistributions.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
- It wasn't you, that question was inherently hard to answer.
- I provided you with two marginal distributions but asked a question about a binomial distribution that is related to their joint distribution
- We do this strange thing in visualisation where we display marginal and disributions of our variables and then expect them to to answer every possible question we could have about our data, regardless of whether or not those distributions are relevant.
- For statisticians to spend so much time working out which distribution describes which phenomena, it's a little sad to ignore it when generating visualisations
- This is a really pervasive problem to, it's not uncommon for papers to compare plots that depict two different distributions and then compare them using a question only one of them can actually answer
- In this case, since the joint distribution actually has the information I am asking about, this question is much easier to answer if I give you the joint distribution

## Questions 7
### The Best Features
:::

# Leftover
- features section
- mention the four visual features of a graph and that depicting the wrong features is bad
- Q7: the error bar question (which of these four plots depicts statistical significance)
- the error bar problem
- showing the correct distribution isn't enough, you have to identify the correct features of that distribution
- alternative error depiction (?)
- hierarchy section
- Q8: what is the hierarchy of information presented in this plot? (list of features and some rediculous plot)
- putting it together
- many advancements in plots have been just applying these concepts
- that's it for chapter 1 of my thesis, you guys beat the consultants ___ out of ___ times.
- discussion of chapter 2
- discussion of chapter 3
- additional work
- timeline
