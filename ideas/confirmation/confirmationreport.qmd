# Thesis Title
- Entire report needs to be 10-20 pages

# Motivation/Literature Review
- Explanation of several reasons uncertainty visualisation needs to be investigated:
1) Importance of visualising uncertainty
2) Why people often don't visualise uncertainty even in simple cases (Part 1 but with less of a focus on that one paper)
3) Cases where people want/need to visualise uncertainty but methods are lacking (such as spatial/temporal)
4) Motivation: energy forecasts and importance of unertainty vis for clean energy 

# Thesis Overview 
- Replace projects with (phase/stage/chapter/problems/questions)
- brief detail of the proposed content of all chapters. 
- description of the theoretical and conceptual framework that underlies the thesis, and procedures to be used in addressing the research questions
- Project 1: the stuff detailled in PhD writings on blog. Basically a literature review of the current state of uncertainty visualisation
- Project 2: Maybe an experiment/ application of ideas tests (AEMO application maybe)
- Project 3: Technical outputs (translation of research) - possibly a package

# Project 1 Details
- A more detailed explanation of the element (e.g. chapter), to be presented orally
- Explain the current state of uncertainty visualisation research
- Definition of uncertainty (not sure if the taxonomy should go here)
- Explain rethinking uncertainty visualisation in terms of the motivation of the plot (the research question) instead of "best" uncertainty visualisation.
- Show that we can find a best distribution visualisation and reintroduce context to get a good uncertainty plot for that question and context.
- Classification of current plots and research questions that have been shown to be effective for those types of plots
- Reintroduce context

# Timeline
- A timetable for completing the thesis and a statement of progress to date
- ASC later in year (submitted an abstract for a poster)
- IEEE VIS (June 22 2023 poster abstract) - Conference October 2023 
- Aim for something international in a year (or in last year)
- Also could do UseR! & talk about some of the software developed (technical output)
- Could have an energy specific one (various applied energy)
- IEEE VIS (march 31st paper due in 2025) - Conference October 2025 (Vienna)
- Thesis due December 2025
