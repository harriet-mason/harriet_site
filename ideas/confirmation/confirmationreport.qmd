# Motivation/Literature Review
- Explanation of several reasons uncertainty visualisation needs to be investigated:
1) Importance of visualising uncertainty
2) Definition of uncertainty (not sure if the taxonomy should go here)
3) Why people often don't visualise uncertainty even in simple cases (Part 1 but with less of a focus on that one paper)
4) Cases where people want/need to visualise uncertainty but methods are lacking (such as spatial/temporal)

# Scope of 3 Projects
- Project 1: the stuff detailled in PhD writings on blog. Basically a literature review of the current state of uncertainty visualisation
- Project 2: Maybe an experiment on the ideas established in project 1. Like we test the categories I established?
- Project 3: cassowaryr extension

# Project 1 Details
- Explain the current state of uncertainty visualisation research
- Explain rethinking uncertainty visualisation in terms of the motivation of the plot (the research question) instead of "best" uncertainty visualisation.
- Show that we can find a best distribution visualisation and reintroduce context to get a good uncertainty plot for that question and context.
- Classification of current plots and research questions that have been shown to be effective for those types of plots
- Should I mention working with AEMO or leave that for now?

# Project 2 and 3 Plans

# Timeline
- ASC later in year
