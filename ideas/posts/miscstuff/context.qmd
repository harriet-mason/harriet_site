### Contextual Information
One of the key components of uncertainty and inference is the noise and signal dichotomy. When @Otsuka2023 discusses the information we boil away to create a "probabilistic kind" he uses the example of a coin flip and the sex of baby births as two things that are *very* different in reality, but it is only through the lens of a Bernoulli distribution that we can view these two things as the same. The fact is that this boiling down, of a real world event into data, is not something that happens independent of the statisticians, but is just as much as product of our interests (the particular relationship we hope to draw inference on) as it is a product of the event's natural properties. This is expressed simply in the text with an extension to the coin flipping example:

> "Recall that we modeled a coin toss by a Bernoulli distribution. That was because we supposed the coin will land either heads or tails and ignored the possibility of its landing on its edge. If we are to take the latter possibility into account, we should use a multinational distribution with three categories. As this example shows, the question of which statistical model we should use is not just determined by the physical nature of the object under study, but rather depends on the modelerâ€™s interests and intentions." @Otsuka2023

With this in mind, let us turn to the concept of "contextual" information. For the purposes of this review, we will consider contextual information to be anything that makes it easy for the audience to connect the data from a probabilistic kind to its real world parallel, but is largely irrelevant in the abstract probability space. A key example of this is spatial information, such as borders, road locations, terrains, etc. Spatial information is *highly relevant* when we translate from the abstract domain back into real world for communication. It can help provide reasons for *why* there may be specific characteristics in our data, however it is not required information for the model. @fig-datapipe shows the process of boiling information down into data, visualising it, and choosing whether or not to including contextual information to improve our scientific reasoning. The concept that contextual information is not the same as statistical information is also highlighted in *The Grammar of Graphics* which states:

> "Geography is anchored in real space-time and statistics in abstract dimensions. This is a distinction along a continuum rather than a sharp break... but this difference in focus clearly means that a system optimized to handle geography will not be graceful when dealing with statistical graphics." @Leland2005

Data pipeline with visualisations to show why we are ignoring contextual information in the case of uncertainty visualisation. The visualisations that depict the data are similar to typical statistical graphics. The Australia example depicts a heat map for temperature in Australia. The statistical level of this graphic is no different than a typical density plot that could be made with  exist with any data. The geographic information is merely used to provide real world context to the statistical message we extract from graphic, however that addition is of great importance. The USA example depicts a map showing the voting proportions in a US election. This map illustrates another example of a spatial graphic, however the location of the data is only loosely related to the real world geographic location. The graphic maintains readability because the proportion of votes matters as the US state level, and the number of people in a state and its proportion of votes are far more important for drawing inference on who won an election than specific spatial information. Notice: Both Graphic needs to be fixed up.

For the remaining of this paper, we are not going to differentiate uncertainty visualisation using contextual information, despite the fact that it is common in the field. Our reasoning for this is that organising the field according to contextual information, promotes the idea that uncertainty is a concept specific to data qualities and ignores the role of inferential statistics.

While other discussions of uncertainty may consider this distinction more relevant to their work, here we will consider this contextual information. Contextual information is important for interpretation and understanding of graphics, but it does not in of itself generate uncertainty. Its relevance to the field of "uncertainty visualisation" is through the perceived lack of available channels. For example, a choropleth map has already used colour to represent an estimate, and position to represent spatial information, which is sometimes relevant to the probabilistic kind, and other times it is simply contextual information (such as when the modelling is done by using a state as a category rather than its geographic information). These two cases, when the spatial information is model relevant and when it is contextual, are rarely separated. It can lead authors to believe the spatial information is always of the highest importance, and thus it is always given the position axis, even when it is not, especially with respect to the uncertainty in a model. A confidence interval is a confidence interval whether it came from spatial data, temporal, or cross sectional data. 

Similar to the confusing definition of uncertainty, the constant conflation of statistical and contextual information also creates a wide range of problems. @Kinkeldey2014 discussed how uncertainty  can be represented by three components attribute (what) position (where) and temporal (when) and that studied typically deal with uncertainty around attribute but rarely position and time, however it is never specified what considerations should cause attribute uncertainty to be different to position or temporal uncertainty. @Kay2016 did an experiment that showed uncertainty around bus arrival times, however the visualisation used in the experiment, shown in @fig-bus, is indistinguishable from most work that would be considered "attribute" uncertainty. 

![The uncertainty visualisation used by @Kay2016 to show the uncertainty around a bus arrival time prediction. The data being a "time" estimate does not prohibit the authors from using a density plot, a visualisation method that is typically used for attributes. The time element is irrelevant because the viewer is concerned about their estimated wait time NOW, not how this estimate will change over time. The predictions relationship to any predictors is assumed to be irrelevant in this visualisation.](bustime.png){#fig-bus width=50%}

This paper focuses on uncertainty, specifically uncertainty that is still in the the abstract *statistics* domain. Spatial and temporal uncertainty papers limit how they communicate their uncertainty because they are considering what can be visualised inside the context provided by maps and, not what they should *try* to visualise based on the uncertainty abstraction. When we view a spatial-temporal visualisation through the lens of trying to visualise the distribution of $P(X|longitude, latitude, time)$ there is no reason this is any different from any other high dimensional visualisation problem. 

In this sense we are not proposing that the current conceptualisation of data according to its physical properties is necessarily wrong, or that it leads to conclusions that are not necessarily specific to spatial or temporal data, and it may lead us to miss relevant information that is outside our domain. This is not only the case for uncertainty data. @Slingsby2023 discussed using a gridded glyph map for spatial modelling, however the statistical elements are identical to a fluctuation diagram depicting $f(infection|time, age, longitude, latitude)$ presented in @Wickham2011. A side by side depiction of the two graphics is displayed in @fig-prodplots. The plot by @Slingsby2023 is simply a special case of the graphic by @Wickham2011, where a separate visualisation is made for each time point, the continuous function $infection | age$ has replaced the categorical variable $happy$, a fade is added for the population size, and a map is shown in the background. @Slingsby2023 presents other maps in the paper, however they are also special cases of the product plots framework. This is not to say this extension is uninteresting, on the contrary we believe identifying cases where particular graphics are useful is a worthwhile endeavour, but these plots seem to be have been developed unaware of the existing statistical framework. When we separate the field of visualisation along lines that may not be of particular relevance, we increase the likelihood of "reinventing the wheel" in each sub-discipline.

A side by side comparison of the gridded glyphmap and the fluctuation diagram. One is considered a spatial visualisation technique and the other is considered a normal statistical diagram. The product plot and the gridded glyph map are visualisations depicting the relationship $f(w|x,y,z)$ and the similarity in the two plots shows that this three (or 4) variable relationship is the key feature of statistical importance, not the spatial nature of the data. The limitations faced by spatial visualisation are often identical to the limitations faces by information visualisation and creating unnecessary divides within the field makes it more difficult to navigate and find relevant statistical visualisations.
