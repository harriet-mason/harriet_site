These scatter plots take a HUGE amount of time to find the delauney triangulation for no clear reason. Any clear visual feature of the scatter plot can be replicated in another but it does not take as long. This problem is not a feature of the delauney triangulation itself. The tri.mesh function is computed almost instantaneously with tripack, but takes significantly longer with interp. An example of a scatter plot that takes a very long time is below. I compared the time it takes for each package to compute the triangulation, including tRiad, the suggested replacement for interp.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(fitzRoy)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(interp)\nlibrary(cassowaryr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n# triad is not on CRAN\n# devtools::install_github(\"ZeroDawn0D/tRiad\")\nlibrary(tRiad)\n\n# Get data and find scatter plot that is instant and long scatter plot\naflw <- fetch_player_stats(2020, comp = \"AFLW\")\n\naflw_num <- aflw %>%\n  select_if(is.numeric)\n\naflw_num <- aggregate(aflw_num[,5:37],\n                      list(aflw$player.player.player.surname),\n                      mean)\n\n# problem scatter plots\na <- aflw_num$goals\nc <- aflw_num$handballs\n\n# plot it\nplot(a,c)\n\n#Follow code down to tri.mesh \n# to make sure I have the same input\nac <- cbind(cassowaryr:::unitize(a), cassowaryr:::unitize(c))\ndupes <- paste(a, c, sep =\",\")\nac <- ac[!duplicated(dupes),]\nx <- ac\ny = NULL\nX <- xy.coords(x, y)\n\nsystem.time(interp::tri.mesh(X))\nsystem.time(tripack::tri.mesh(X))\nsystem.time(tRiad::del.tri(X))\nsystem.time(tRiad::DelTri(a,c))\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor most scatter plots interp performs a faster delauney triangulation than the C++ DelTri function in tRiad. This is only really noticiable when working with scatter plots that have a large number of points.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# small scatter plot\nx <- runif(500)\ny <- runif(500)\nplot(x,y)\nsystem.time(tRiad::DelTri(x,y))\nsystem.time(interp::tri.mesh(x,y))\n\n# big scatter plot\nx <- runif(5000)\ny <- runif(5000)\nplot(x,y)\nsystem.time(tRiad::DelTri(x,y))\nsystem.time(interp::tri.mesh(x,y))\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor most plots interp is faster than tRiad, resulting in a lower time on average, however the issue of the occasional *very long* computation time on an interp plot results in a much higher variance. This issue occurs occasionally in simulated continuous data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# set seed\nset.seed(1)\n# set n\nn <- 1000\n  \n# time vector\ntriadtime <- rep(0, n)\ninterptime <- rep(0, n)\n  \n  # run a bunch of times\nfor(i in seq(n)){\n  x <- runif(500)\n  y <- runif(500)\n  triadtime[i] <- system.time(tRiad::DelTri(x,y))[[3]]\n  interptime[i] <- system.time(before_interp(x,y))[[3]]\n}\n\n# compare visually\ntimetable <- tibble(\n  triad = triadtime,\n  interp = interptime\n) \n\ntimetable %>%\n  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to=\"package\", values_to=\"time\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=package, y=time, colour=package)) +\n  geom_jitter(width=0.5, height=0)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhat is of greater concern is that this problem occurs much more frequently in real, non-simulated, data sets.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# interp throws an error without preprocessing, so I'm making an in between function\nprep_interp <- function(x,y){\n  xy <- cbind(cassowaryr:::unitize(x), cassowaryr:::unitize(y))\n  dupes <- paste(x, y, sep =\",\")\n  xy <- xy[!duplicated(dupes),]\n  x <- xy\n  y = NULL\n  X <- xy.coords(x, y)\n  system.time(interp::tri.mesh(X))\n}\n\nprep_triad <- function(x,y){\n  xy <- cbind(cassowaryr:::unitize(x), cassowaryr:::unitize(y))\n  dupes <- paste(x, y, sep =\",\")\n  xy <- xy[!duplicated(dupes),]\n  system.time(tRiad::DelTri(xy[,1],xy[,2]))\n}\n\n# calculate time on collection of scatter plots\naflw_test <- aflw_num[,2:9]\n\ncombinations <- expand.grid(colnames(aflw_test), colnames(aflw_test)) %>%\n    dplyr::filter(!(Var1==Var2))\n\n# Write as a for loop because tidy version was a nightmare to debug\nn <- length(combinations$Var1)\ntriadtime <- rep(0, n)\ninterptime <- rep(0, n)\n\nfor(i in seq(n)){\n  x <- dplyr::pull(aflw_test,var=combinations$Var1[i])\n  y <- dplyr::pull(aflw_test, var=combinations$Var2[i])\n  triadtime[i] <- prep_triad(x, y)[[3]]\n  interptime[i] <- prep_interp(x, y)[[3]]\n}\n\n# put into a tibble and plot\ntimetable <- tibble(\n  triad = triadtime,\n  interp = interptime\n) \n\ntimetable %>%\n  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to=\"package\", values_to=\"time\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=package, y=time, colour=package)) +\n  geom_jitter(width=0.3, height=0)\n\ncombinations[which(interptime>50),]\n```\n:::\n\n\nAdditionally the interp package occasionally throws an error on scatter plots that are visually indistinguishable from plots that do not throw an error. These scatter plots work fine\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plot that throws an error\nd <- aflw_num$totalPossessions\ne <- aflw_num$contestedPossessions\nplot(d,e)\n\n#Follow code down to tri.mesh \n# to make sure I have the same input\nde <- cbind(cassowaryr:::unitize(d), cassowaryr:::unitize(e))\ndupes <- paste(d, e, sep =\",\")\nde <- de[!duplicated(dupes),]\nx <- de\ny = NULL\nX <- xy.coords(x, y)\n\n# compare methods\nsystem.time(tripack::tri.mesh(X))\nsystem.time(tRiad::DelTri(d,e))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsystem.time(interp::tri.mesh(X))\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhile the faster tRiad triangulation is written in C++, it also has a version of its functions written in R. This makes it easier for the R community to contribute and debug the code. From my understanding of interp, the actual delauney triangulation is computed using the shull.deltri function from the C shull library. So tRiad has additional transparency that interp does not.\n\nDue to the issues with interp caused by computation time, errors, and transparency, I think it would be beneficial to swap the alphahull package to tRiad.\n\n## Changes\n\n### In cassowaryr\n\n### In alphahull\n\n## Do things work?\n\n## Triad issues\n\nGSOC article doesn't work if you try and run the code because it has triad instead of tRiad\nReadme has library(\"triad\") and I'm not sure if the quotations hurt anything\nIt might be beneficial to allow the tRiad functions to be called in the same way alphahull calls interp. It works for the R version of the function, i.e. tRiad::del.tri(X) runs, but the C++ version of the function does not.\nDeltri seems to take an infinitely long time if there are duplicate points? Looking at case of aflw behinds vs goals plot. The other methods give an error, I'm not sure what is happening in it since I can't read C++. I'm not sure about the the triad R version.\n",
