Unfortunately, my sister decided to get engaged and her fiance was all \"its weird that we live with your hermit sister\" and \"you two have been co-dependent for years its unhealthy and it's time to stop\". When I moved in with my friends at the beginning of the year I was immediately tossed in to a long strict lock down. I had to deal with living in a house of people I liked, all of which had no schedule and were all bored out of their minds, so, to cut a long story short, we all started drinking a lot. I have since significantly cut back (I have gone back to my original \"barely once a month\" amount), but during our trial period for high functioning alcoholism, our friend Fynn introduced us to a \"guess your uni grades\" drinking game. Here is how it works:\n\n1) Guess your mark for all the units you are taking this semester \n2) When you get your results, calculate the difference between your guess and your actual result. *e.g. if you guess 51 for Topology and actually get a 73 because the exam was scaled, you get 22 points.*\n3) Take your points for each unit and sum them up. *e.g. If topology got you 22 points, data structures 7 points, and a project unit was 3 points, your total is 32 points.*\n4) If you did not do a 4 unit work load, you scale your points up and round to the nearest integer to match that. *e.g. if you had 32 points and did 3 units, your scaled score is 43.*\n5) The number of points you have is the number of drinks you have to do.\n\nFynn's version is proper shots. Unfortunately because the example case was based on my housemate Tom, who apparently has next to no idea how he is doing in his courses, we had to change our rules to shots of mixed drinks. Even with this change we calculated that there was still a chance Tom would be killed by alcohol poisoning. After a 3-1 house vote we agreed we were willing to make that sacrifice for the sanctity of the game. My housemates in order of least to most points were: \n\n1) Zac with 4 drinks\n2) Me with 13 drinks\n3) Em with 17 drinks\n4) Tom with 43 drinks\n\n",
