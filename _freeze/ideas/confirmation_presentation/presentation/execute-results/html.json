Half of it will be a quiz show, and the other half will be a normal, serious, presentation.\n\n:::\n\n## The Structure of This Presentation\n### Part 1: Quiz Show\n- Motivation (Q1-4)\n  - The need for uncertainty visualisations\n  - The need for a new taxonomy\n- Chapter 1 (Q5-8)\n  - Details of the visual information taxonomy \n\n::: {.notes}\n\nThe first section will be the work in the first chapter of my PhD. It will be in the form of a quiz show where my research over the past year will be fed to you as explanations or preamble to a quiz question. Questions 1 to 4 will be related the current work in uncertainty visualisation and questions 5 to 8 will detail the taxonomy of visual information we designed that allows us to better compare plots.\n\n:::\n\n## The Structure of This Presentation\n### Part 2: Serious Presentation\n- The Rest of the PhD\n  - Chapter 2 & 3\n  - Timeline\n  \n::: {.notes}\n\nThe second section will be an explanation of the work I plan to do for the rest of my PhD, and a timeline for the next few years. This section will not be a quiz show and will just be a normal presentation. Feel free to interrupt at any point with questions, either about the content itself or clarifying questions for the quiz. So if nobody has any questions about the structure...\n\n:::\n\n# Are You Smarter Than A Big 4 Consultant?\n\n::: {.notes}\n\n... lets get quizzing. One of my housemates works at EY as a consultant. She has very little statistics knowledge. She *did* take introduction to econometrics several years ago, however she failed the exam. During this presentation you will have to answer 8 multiple choice questions that involve extracting some information from a data visualisation. She and a couple of her team members have completed this quiz. Your goal as a group is to perform better than the average score for the consultants.\n\nThere is a QR code with a URL floating around that you can and should use to join in on the quiz. This will be no fun if nobody answers it. Each question will get an explanation and then you will have 20 seconds to answer in the flux quiz.\n:::\n\n::: {style=\"text-align: center; margin-top: 6em\"}\n# The Current Literature \n:::

This is a plot of the famous data set, Anscombe's quartet. This data set highlights the importance of visualising your data. Since all 4 plots have the same mean, correlation and standard deviation, they appear identical when you use summary statistics to extract interesting information. \n\nNow, visualisation is not only useful for providing insights.\n:::\n\n## The Importance of Visualisation\n::: {.incremental}\n- Sketching distribution = better predictions ^[@Hullman2018; @Goldstein2014]\n- Interactive graphics = better understanding ^[@Potter2009; @Ancker2009]\n- Infographics = more accessible ^[@Ancker2009]\n:::\n::: {.notes}\n- Something as simple as sketching a distribution before recalling statistics or making predictions can greatly increase the accuracy of those Estimates.  \n- Additionally, since visualisations allow for interactive graphics they provide a more in depth understanding of probability \n- and are more accessible, since infographics can be understood by people with poor numeracy skills. \n\nVisualisation is important, but it is only well done visualisations that provide these benefits.\n:::\n## Question 1: Spot the Odd One Out\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"countdown\" id=\"timer_cbd2571e\" data-update-every=\"1\" tabindex=\"0\" style=\"right:0;bottom:0;margin:0.1em;\">\n<div class=\"countdown-controls\"><button class=\"countdown-bump-down\">&minus;</button><button class=\"countdown-bump-up\">&plus;</button></div>\n<code class=\"countdown-time\"><span class=\"countdown-digits minutes\">00</span><span class=\"countdown-digits colon\">:</span><span class=\"countdown-digits seconds\">20</span></code>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-2.png){width=960}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-3.png){width=960}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-4.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.notes}\nAnd that leads us to our first question. We often don't know the best way to visualise a distribution, nor do we know which variables should go togehter. On this slide I have four data visualisations. Three of them were made using the Anscombe's quartet data, one was made with fake data that was randomly sampled from the real Anscombe's quartet. Which one of the four plots on this page was not made using the real Anscombe's quartet data?\nYou have 20 seconds to answer and your time starts now.\n:::\n\n## Solution\n::::: {.columns}\n\n::::

None of the visualisations shown here identified the interesting features I displayed in the previous slide. These visualisations have the same problem as the numerical summary, because despite being visualisations, they displayed the wrong information. What is rarely discussed about Anscombe's quartet is that we already know the best way to display it to show the important information.\n:::\n\n::: {style=\"text-align: center; margin-top: 6em\"}\n## Questions 2 & 3\n### Decision Making Under Uncertainty\n::: {.notes}\nWhich leads us to our next questions\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## ...Is uncertainty important information?\n::: {.incremental}\n- Only 1/4  of visualisation authors show uncertainty in 50% or more of their graphics. ^[@Hullman2020a]\n- Reasons include:\n  - overwhelm the audience\n  - inability to calculate\n  - a lack of information \n  - not wanting to make their data seem questionable\n\n:::\n::: {.notes}\n- Is uncertainty important information? This isn't a quiz question its rhetorical. The amount we actually visualise uncertainty would lead to believe it isn't. \n- A survey of visualisations authors showed that only a quarter of them included uncertainty in 50% or more of their visualisations. \n- The most common reasons provided were things like \n- a fear of overwhelming the audience, \n- an inability to calculate the uncertainty, \n- not having access to the uncertainty information, \n- and not wanting people to ask them about their results.\n\nWhen we talk about uncertainty, we usually mean the sampling distribution for some estimate. There is an underlying belief in all the reasons provided by visualisation authors that uncertainty is of secondary importance to our estimates. This comes through in the colloquial ways we talk about uncertainty too. We call uncertainty the noise and the estimate the signal. It implies that uncertainty is something we should brush away to find some truth, as though the uncertainty information is not of importance by itself. \n\nThe next two quiz questions are going to be about that hypothesis.\n:::\n\n## A Scenario\n\n::: {.notes}\nI am now going to provide a fictitious scenario that sets the backdrop for the next two questions. \n:::\n\n## A Scenario \n::: {style=\"font-size: 80%;\"}\nIt is currently 9pm and you are sitting at home watching TV.\n:::\n\n## A Scenario \n::: {style=\"font-size: 80%;\"}\nIt is currently 9pm and you are sitting at home watching TV.

There are 6 options on the slide.

I mean what even is a visualisation of uncertainty. \n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Alternative Taxonomy\n::: {fig-align=\"center\"}\n<iframe width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/directory-of-visualizations.html\"></iframe>\n:::\n\n::: {.notes}\nThere are quite a few taxonomies or organisation systems for visualisations. Here is an example of one, it is from the Fundamentals of Data Visualization book and it organises visualisations into the 7 categories: \n\n- (See Webpage)\n\nThere are many other organisation methods, but they all suffer from the same problem. A lot of the distinctions between plots are quite arbitrary and doesn't meaningfully group the visualisations. They are also quite inflexbile, so we end up with a bunch of different names for what is functionally the same plot used on different data. \n:::\n\n## Question 4: Apply the Alternative Taxonomy\nWhich of these plots are uncertainty visualisations?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"countdown\" id=\"timer_c523b331\" data-update-every=\"1\" tabindex=\"0\" style=\"right:0;bottom:0;margin:0.1em;\">\n<div class=\"countdown-controls\"><button class=\"countdown-bump-down\">&minus;</button><button class=\"countdown-bump-up\">&plus;</button></div>\n<code class=\"countdown-time\"><span class=\"countdown-digits minutes\">00</span><span class=\"countdown-digits colon\">:</span><span class=\"countdown-digits seconds\">20</span></code>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n![](6dists.jpeg){fig-align=\"center\" width=80%}\n\n:::{ .notes}\nSince we have the category of \"uncertainty visualisation\" some plots must belong to that group, while others don't. If that was not the case, why even discuss \"uncertainty visualisation\" as it's own topic. So, your 4th quiz question is \"which of these plots are uncertainty visualisations? You have 20 seconds and your time starts now.\n:::\n\n## Solution\nThey all are.\n\n\n![](6dists.jpeg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n[Results](https://flux.qa/#/presentations/64805896ff94fa54629cd870/6480588eff94fa54629cd86e?tab=polls&poll=64882dc7ff94fa54629cf56a){preview-link=\"true\"}\n\n\n::: {.notes}\nThey all are. All the plots shown in the previous slide are by some paper or another considered an uncertainty visualisation. \n\n- 0% of the consultants picked the all the plots. However a bar chart was the only plot nobody picked. Lets see how you did.\n\nThis result makes sense when you really think about it.\n\n- Looking at a scatter plot gives us an idea of mass, but that is something that the eye plot also does. \n- A boxplot doesn't give a good idea of mass but it does highlight several percentile thresholds, something that error bars do which we generally consider to be an uncertainty distribution. \n- A bar chart and a choropleth map can both be consided an outcome of a sample just like a scatter plot but also we can consider uncertainty by changing the value the plot express to a probability. \n\nThese plots have more similarities across groups than differences between them. It makes you start to wonder if there is no such thing as an uncertainty visualisation. And that is exactly my point.\n:::\n\n## What's an \"Uncertainty Visualisation\"\n\n![](scribblemess.jpeg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::{ .notes}\nIf there is no classification of \"uncertainty visualisation\", how would we visualise uncertainty? Would we provide an expression of multiple possible values, a probability estimate, some feature that would allow us to identify a distribution?\n\nThere isn't really an answer for this. We don't have a good concept of what it even means to visualise a distribution. There is no way to find gaps in our current visualisation literature if we don't even know what that literature covers. We need to have a better language to discuss the information a plot displays. \n:::\n\n::: {style=\"text-align: center; margin-top: 6em\"}\n## When comparing visual features, remember...\n. . . \n\n### ...plots can only be compared if they contain the same information.^[@Cleveland1984]\n\n::: {.notes}\nIdentifying gaps in the current visualisation methods isn't the only reason we need a taxonomy, there is a second, more meta, reason it's needed. In order to compare plots, \n\n- they need to contain the same information. \n\nOtherwise, we cannot be sure if one plot outperforms the other because of a gap in the information or a difference in the way that information is displayed. Papers that compare plots that have wildly different information are everywhere in the infoviz literature because once you go beyond expressing a single value, what we define as information becomes complicated. A unified language around what information is contained in a plot will allow us to more easily recognise which plots are appropriate to compare.\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {style=\"text-align: center; margin-top: 6em\"}\n# A Taxonomy for Visualisation Information\n\n:::{ .notes}\nSo, without further ado, lets dive into the taxonomy and quiz questions 4 to 8.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## The Three Elements of the Taxonomy\n\n![](3elements.jpeg){fig-align=\"center\" width=60%}\n\n::: {.notes}\nThere are three features of a visualisation that we should consider when we want to understand the information it conveys. \n\n- First, you need to ask yourself what distribution your plot depicts and if it is the best distribution for the questions we want to answer. \n- Second you need to ask what features of that distribution are depicted and if those features convey the information we want. \n- Finally you need to consider the hierarchy we implicitly give to those features, and ask if we are drawing attention to the information we think is important.\n:::\n\n::: {style=\"text-align: center; margin-top: 6em\"}\n## Questions 5 & 6\n### Distribution\n::: {.notes}\nQuestions 5 and 6 will focus on the first aspect of the taxonomy, the distribution. \n:::\n:::\n\n## Question 5: Class A vs Class B #1\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"countdown\" id=\"timer_a2f02b7a\" data-update-every=\"1\" tabindex=\"0\" style=\"right:0;bottom:0;margin:0.1em;\">\n<div class=\"countdown-controls\"><button class=\"countdown-bump-down\">&minus;</button><button class=\"countdown-bump-up\">&plus;</button></div>\n<code class=\"countdown-time\"><span class=\"countdown-digits minutes\">00</span><span class=\"countdown-digits colon\">:</span><span class=\"countdown-digits seconds\">20</span></code>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n:::: {.columns .v-center-container}\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n::: {style=\"font-size: 100%;\"}\n::: {.incremental}\n- Two primary school classes independent height distributions \n- Obsessed with the spirit of competition\n- Height competition (?)\n  - The winning class gets a pizza party\n  - Pizza party not relevant\n- How often is a student from Class A taller than a student from Class B?\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n::::\n\n::: {.notes}\n- The plot on the right shows two independent distributions of student heights from two primary school classes, class A and B, that are \n- obsessed with competing with each other. \n- Most recently they have started competing on heights.

Depictions of mass can inform us of the mode, likely values, and whether or not we have an identifiable distribution.\n- Samples are actual or simulated outcomes from our distribution. Our data falls into this category. This feature is useful in answering questions about frequency or probability. \n- Parameters are the statistics that are related to our distribution. The mean and variance are examples of parameters. Plots that show parameters are quite flexible since they can depict almost anything, but usually the scope of each plot is limited.\n- The last feature is exchangeability which illustrates whether or not elements from a sequence of random variables in this distribution can be swapped. Rather than wanting to answer specific questions about exchangeability, it is usually just something we want to highlight in our data, typically by connecting elements or having them touch. \n- This list is not exhaustive nor is each element entirely distinct. A particular visualisations of a sample may double as a depiction of mass and also highlight something entirely different\n- However, these features do provide a solid basis for assessing the information conveyed by a graphic.\n- Now, lets get to our quiz question.\n:::\n## A Real High School Story \n::: {style=\"font-size: 85%;\"}\nWhen I was in high school we had to do very precise scientific experiments with pretty shoddy equipment, so it wasn't unusual to get results that were all over the place. \n:::\n\n## A Real High School Story \n::: {style=\"font-size: 85%;\"}\nWhen I was in high school we had to do very precise scientific experiments with pretty shoddy equipment, so it wasn't unusual to get results that were all over the place.

This question illustrates an issue I call the error bar problem\n- While it is true that error bars that do not overlap implies statistical significance, overlapping error bars do not imply the converse. \n- However most people think two means are statistically significantly different right up until the error bars touch.\n- In the case of independent confidence intervals, the p-value of the two-tailed t-test for error bars that just touch is about 0.006.\n\nThe papers that go on to cite these misunderstandings about error bars discuss the work as though the problems are caused by the error bars themselves. They suggest that error bars should be avoided as a visualisation tool, ignoring the fact that these fundamental misunderstandings in uncertainty will likely follow other visual encodings if we don't understand how to improve it. There are two things we could do to improve this visualisation. We could change the distribution so depicts the distribution of the hypothesis test in question, or we could highlight different features that are more relevant to the probability of concern\n:::\n\n## Hypothesis Test Visualisation\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.notes}\n- For example, here is a visualisation of a hypothesis test where we are testing if the red distribution is significantly different from the black distribution\n- Let's say we want to visualise the probability of a type 2 error.\n- The number of points (out of 100) from the red distribution that fall in the black circle show that probability\n- to find the type 1 error we would swap the features of the two distributions\n- Thinking about the features that depict the information we want to convey can lead to unique and more versatile visualisations\n:::\n\n::: {style=\"text-align: center; margin-top: 6em\"}\n## Question 8\n### Hierarchy\n::: {.notes}\nNow we can move on to our third taxonomy element and final quiz question\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Question 8: Gut Hierarchy\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"countdown\" id=\"timer_3d07f685\" data-update-every=\"1\" tabindex=\"0\" style=\"right:0;bottom:0;margin:0.1em;\">\n<div class=\"countdown-controls\"><button class=\"countdown-bump-down\">&minus;</button><button class=\"countdown-bump-up\">&plus;</button></div>\n<code class=\"countdown-time\"><span class=\"countdown-digits minutes\">00</span><span class=\"countdown-digits colon\">:</span><span class=\"countdown-digits seconds\">20</span></code>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOrder the features **location, estimate, and error** by their importance implied by the map below.\n\n![](glyphmap.jpeg){fig-align=\"center\" width=60%}\n\n::: {.notes}\nYour final question is, to order the features in this map by their implied importance. You have 20 seconds starting now.\n:::\n\n## Solution\n1) Location\n2) Estimate\n3) Error\n\n[Results](https://flux.qa/#/presentations/64805896ff94fa54629cd870/6480588eff94fa54629cd86e?tab=polls&poll=648059aaff94fa54629cd881){preview-link=\"true\"}\n\n::: {.notes}\nThe correct ordering is location, then estimate, then error. The consultant, on average, got this one right  50% of the time. And you guys by comparison got it right...\n:::\n\n## Elementary Tast Hierarchy\nThe @Cleveland1984 hierarchy:\n\n  1) Position along a common scale\n\n  2) Positions along non-aligned scales\n\n  3) Length, direction (slope), angle (starting from the same origin)\n\n  4) Area\n\n  5) Volume, curvature\n\n  6) Colour value, colour saturation\n\n::: {.notes}\n- The concept of a hierarchy of visual features in a graphic isn't new and has a pretty extensive literature. \n- This is an established hierarchy of basic visual features. It is not exhaustive nor mutually exclusive, but it does provide a useful rule of thumb in understanding the level of importance we give information in a graph. \n- This paper is also quite old, so more modern aesthetics such as animation or glyphs aren't not tested. \n- If we look at the previous map, we can see location is mapped to the position, the  estimate is mapped to the colour value, and the error is mapped to the glyph rotation which does not appear in this hierarchy, but is generally considered to be low on the list.\n\n:::\n\n## Using Heuristics\n::: {.incremental}\n- Take advantage of heuristics\n- Error Mapping ^[@Maceachren2012]\n  - Good: fuzziness, location, and colour value\n  - OK: arrangement, size and transparency\n  - Ugly: saturation, hue, orientation and shape\n- Mapping direction\n  - e.g more fuzzy = higher error\n\n:::\n::: {.notes}\n- Not only should we considered the hierarchy in the information we display, but also the heuristics that connect some pieces of information to specific elementary tasks. \n- For example, error is best mapped to\n- fuzziness, location, and colour value;\n- arrangement, size and transparency are an OK second choice;\n- but saturation, hue, orientation and shape are unacceptable and have no intuitive connection to uncertainty. \n- Not only do the graphical elements we map our features to matter, but the direction matters too. \n- for exmaple, graphical elements that are more fuzzy convey a higher uncertainty. \n\nTherefore we should not only keep the hierarchy of information in mind when we map features of our distribution, but also take advantage of these intuitive mappings when we can. You can't just to put the right features from the right distribution on a graph, you need to allow that information to be efficiently extracted. Including information that is so hard to see that it is functionally invisible is the same as not plotting it at all.\n:::\n\n## Pixel Map ^[@lucchesi2021vizumap]\n\n![](pixelmap.jpeg){fig-align=\"center\" width=60%}\n\n::: {.notes}\nWhen you understand the three visual features, you will notice that some newer plots are just plotting a specific feature with a high priority in a distribution where we typically ignore that feature.\n\nThis is a pixel map from the Vizumap package which is a visualisation of uncertainty that basically boils down to a choropleth map that swaps the visualisation of a parameter out for a sample. \n:::\n\n## Fin: The Taxonomy of Visual Information\n![](3elements.jpeg){fig-align=\"center\" width=60%}\n\n::: {.notes}\nSo that is it for the taxonomy for information in visualisations, and the end of the quiz and Chapter 1. Congratulations you guys are ___ smarter than a big 4 consultant. \n:::\n\n# Future Work\n\n::: {.notes}\nNow, I am going to move on to the more serious section where I discuss future work and its timeline.\n:::\n\n## Chapter 2\n::: {.incremental}\n- Test this framework\n- Identify gaps in current methods\n- AEMO need high dimensional uncertainty visualisations\n- Find lacking areas\n- Apply taxonomy to make better visualisations\n:::\n::: {.notes}\n- The goal of chapter 2 will be to test this framework and then apply it to fill gaps in our visualisation tools.\n- First we would run some experiments to test the effectiveness of this taxonomy compared to the current ways we think of information in graphics. Once we have some evidence behind the taxonomy, or some version of it, we can use it to design visualisations that fill gaps in the current methods similar to the pixel map.\n- My PhD is sponsored by the Australian energy market operator (AEMO) who have a need for effective high dimensional uncertainty visualisations \n- By working with them we will investigate areas where they have found the current visualisation tools to be lacking  \n- Then we will apply the taxonomy to try and improve their current methods\n:::\n\n## Chapter 3\n::: {.incremental}\n- Applications of Chapters 1 and 2\n- Possible directions\n  - Visualisations developed for AEMO\n  - Software for visualising uncertainty information in energy data or more broadly\n  \n:::\n::: {.notes}\n- Chapter 3 will focus on applying the work established in chapters 1 and 2 to real world outputs. \n- This chapter of the work could go in a number of ways, depending on how the work in chapter 2 pans out. \n- If the research done in chapter 2 is predominantly focused on results in the energy industry, this chapter will be a discussion on the visualisations used by AEMO that were directed by this research, and the real world impacts of those improvements. \n- Another research output could be software that is specific for visualising uncertainty information in energy data, or if the research output is applicable more broadly, tools that makes it easier to implement these principals into the data analysis workflow. \n\n:::\n\n## Upcomming Key Dates\n|Date|Description|\n|:-|:---|\n|June 2023| Meeting with AEMO team to map out future monthly meetings over the next year and build up applications of uncertainty visualisations|\n|June 2023|Confirmation milestone|\n|June 2023|Submit poster for IEEE VIS 2023|\n|July 2023| Complete chapter 1|\n|August 2023| Start initial experiments for Chapter 2|\n|December 2023| Attend ASC and present poster on taxonomy|\n|May 2024| Progress review milestone |\n\n\n## Full Timeline\n::: {style=\"font-size: 45%;\"}\n|Date|Description|\n|:-|:---|\n|May 2022| Changed topic to uncertainty visualisation with new scholarship funded by AEMO |\n|August-November 20232| Took leave from PhD|\n|May 2023| Met with Dean Sharafi, Alireza Fereidouni, and Toby Price from the AEMO Systems Design and Transformation team to discuss current issues they are facing in uncertainty visualisation|\n|June 2023| Meeting with AEMO team to map out future monthly meetings over the next year and build up applications of uncertainty visualisations|\n|June 2023|Confirmation milestone|\n|June 2023| Submit poster abstract on aspects of the literature review for IEEE VIS 2023|\n|July 2023| Complete chapter 1, a detailed literature review paper that captures the key aspects of the infoviz community and submit to a journal|\n|August 2023| Start initial experiments for Chapter 2 of the thesis|\n|October 2023| Attend IEEE VIS 2023|\n|December 2023| Attend ASC and present poster on taxonomy of uncertainty visualisations with results from preliminary experiments|\n|April 2024| Submit paper summarising key findings from experiments |\n|May 2024| Progress review milestone |\n|September 2024| Attend POSIT::CONF(2024)|\n|October 2024| Attend IEEE VIS 2024|\n|April 2024| Submit paper for Chapter 3 |\n|May 2025| Pre-submission milestone|\n|October 2025| Attend IEEE VIS 2025 in Vienna |\n|November 2025| Attend UseR! conference to discuss software developed for translation of uncertainty visualisation work (if applicable)|\n|December 2025| Submit Thesis |\n:::\n\n# End\n\n## Bibliography\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
