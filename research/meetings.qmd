# Supervisor Meetings
## 2023 March 2nd
  
#### General
- I made this website to store information and posts and stuff. It keeps everything together which I like.
  
#### Uncertainty Literature Review
- Finished writing the first blog post and published it here under "posts"
  
#### Experiemnts
- Made a list of experiment ideas from the "why people don't visualise uncertainty" topic which is on the website.
- Added some other experiment ideas for future sections (although I haven't read that much literature on the topics so I am not sure if they are good ideas or not)
  
#### CassowaryR
- Made the hex sticker and added it to the repo (finally)
  
#### Meetings comments and notes
