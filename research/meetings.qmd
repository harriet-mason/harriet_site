# Supervisor Meetings

## 2023 March 9nd

#### General
* Set up github actions so the meeting notes are always up to date.

#### Uncertainty Literature Review
- Just read papers this week, didn't write anything new.

#### CassowaryR
- I fixed the github actions issue, the github actions themselves needed to be updated, it was nothing wrong with the dependencies or code.
- I wrote out a motivation that could be sent to the author of alphahull as to why the swap from interp to tRiad is necessary. It can be found [here](triad/triadswap.qmd)

## 2023 March 2nd
  
#### General
- I made this website to store information and posts and stuff. It keeps everything together which I like.
  
#### Uncertainty Literature Review
- Finished writing the first blog post and published on this website under [posts](https://harriet.quarto.pub/posts/)
  
#### Experiemnts
- Made a list of [experiment ideas](https://harriet.quarto.pub/research/ideas.html) from the "why people don't visualise uncertainty" topic which is on the website. 
- Added some other experiment ideas for future sections (although I haven't read that much literature on the topics so I am not sure if they are good ideas or not)
  
#### CassowaryR
- Made the hex sticker and added it to the [repo](https://github.com/numbats/cassowaryr) (finally)
- The build and stuff work locally on my computer, but fail in the github actions. They all have the same error and I don't know what it means.
  
#### Meetings comments and notes
- To test if people are more likely to visualise uncertainty if it is set as a default, make two packages for people to visualise uncertainty. One where the default is uncertainty and one where it isn't and see if people just leave the default or if they don't like the uncertainty so much they change it. Would need to do some finessing so it is not obvious it is Robs package.
- To test if including uncertainty is the best way to show the differentiation between the data and the forecast compare uncertainty to other methods of differentiating the forecast. Other methods such as a gap, a change in the line colour, or a change in background colour.
- People are often presented with risk as odds relative to the average (e.g. your area has 3x more cancer cases than the average). Could be good to test this method of conveying odds relative to a population level (60 people in your area of 10 000 have cancer and the average is 20 per 10 000).
- To test the cognative overload of uncertainty, we can show different designs and see how long it takes to answer a question on it. Alternatively we can fix the time and see which plot gives people the most accuracy. Try to find a motivating example. If we want to compare it to not visualising at all and just displaying threshold values, create a ladder of choices or categories, however in general it is hard to quantify continuous uncertainty.
- Energy data may be a good motivating example for the fan vs paths display of forecasting uncertainty. Di emailled it as an RDS.
