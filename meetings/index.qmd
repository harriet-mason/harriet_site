# Supervisor Meetings
## 2023 May 4
#### Confirmation
- Should we try and organsise a top three dates? (If everyone is here). It looks like we won't be able to get a date with everyone that Catherine can chair.
- Skim read confirmation reports Di sent me. @Sarah if you have some you think would be helpful for me to read, I would also be keen to read those.
- It looks like the format goes: motivation/literature reivew, brief mentions of scope of 3 the three projects, detailled explanation of project 1 work to date, general discussion of plans for the other two projects, broad timeline of the phd.
- Since I have done an amount of cassowaryr work in the first year, should I detail that in the confirmation report even though its the third topic?
- Should I write it in the abbreviated report format? Is there a template for either of these I should use?

#### Visualising uncertainty
- Should I organise another meeting with Dean?
- Started applying taxonomy to example [here](https://harriet.quarto.pub/ideas/what_is_uncertainty/#applying-the-typology).

## 2023 April 27
#### General
- Teaching ends up taking up a lot of time, especially in later weeks. I don't think I'll teach next semester.
- Github actions arent working and Github token has expired so meeting notes haven't been updating. Will fix before next week.
  
#### ASC
- Wrote poster abstract submission

#### Visualising uncertainty
- Had a meeting with Dean Sharafi, Toby Price and Alireza Fereidouni about the problems with uncertainty that AEMO is facing in WA. The meeting was recorded if you guys want to watch it. They asked if I wanted to work with them on their issue. Said I would go back to you guys and see what you think.
- I ironed out the definition/typology of uncertainty a little more [here](https://harriet.quarto.pub/ideas/what_is_uncertainty)

## 2023 April 20
#### Visualising uncertainty
- Started writing a mathematical definition of uncertainty in part 2 [here](https://harriet.quarto.pub/ideas/what_is_uncertainty/#defining-uncertainty). I am not sure how deep the mathematical definition should go. I was working through it with Tom and 

#### Cassowaryr
- Tried and failed to install interp usig gitlab. Emailled Albercht again. Haven't tried the new installing method that he emailled back


## 2023 April 6
#### General
- I have split the website in two. This website contains meetings notes, teaching help sheets, and written out research ideas. I have also changed the layout and structure.
- I moved blog posts and other public stuff to [netlify](https://harrietmason.netlify.app/). This fixes the size issue for the website and also draws a line between the blog posts and the research posts.

#### Last weeks meeting
- I have spoken to Di already and Ursula isn't here this week so it might not be beneficial to talk about it.
- If there is something you don't understand (or don't understand the whole thing) when I am presenting something I want you guys to tell me or ask about it. Otherwise I don't know what part is the problem and I don't know if the idea is bad or you just don't understand it. I got upset last week because the suggestions and the direction you guys thought I wanted to go with the research made it clear I didn't properly convey what I wanted to do, but the suggestions implied the idea was bad instead of implying a misunderstanding. That's why I was also upset when you suggested the work was good, since it was still clear I hadn't conveyed the idea and it wasn't persuasive.
- If I am going to the effort to explicity ask for something or make it clear its not possible, it is not really negotiable. There are a lot of research topics, so if I am aginst one thing that doesn't mean I am against everything. I am happy to make concessions in other areas, but often it takes a lot of effort for me to tell you guys that something is off the table so I need to it to be understood when I do. Otherwise I will just end up ignoring your advice because I already made it clear what I am and am not willing to do.
- I know there are four of you so you cant all stay updated on meeting notes, so I have tried to make the website more digestible so you can just read it to catch up.
- Also, since I start with an overview and work my way down, citations are the last thing I usually add to my writing. That means when I present a topic I will essentially never have citations. That does not mean I am not basing my work off evidence, it means I haven't done the citations yet.
- Please tell me if there is anything I can do to better communicate with you guys. I am happy to make changes to how I do things, but I don't know if nobody tells me anything.

#### Visualising uncertainty
- Rather than give piece by piece what I am trying to do, I have written up a motivation and outline of my idea [here](https://harriet.quarto.pub/ideas/) and will fill the sections with more detail as I go. Hopefully this will give you guys a better understanding of what I am trying to convey and why I don't want to work on spatial or temporal uncertainty specifically. In the overview I ended up just re-explaining the entire idea because I don't know which parts you guys are confused on so it might seem a little repetitive, sorry. I also included parts that I haven't written yet in the outline to give a better idea of where I want to go with the idea. If you don't understand parts please ask and I will focus on trying to explain that part better. If you fully get the idea and have criticism of it I'm open to hearing it. There are no citations, not because I don't have evidence to back up my claims, but because I typically do citations last. I can describe a paper that backs up each of my points from memory and send it to you if you want, so please don't say I have nothing to back up my claims when I present an overview like this.
- I have removed the intro bits from the posts. I was including them because starting with a diary entry helped me write about the research, but I think they make the posts longer and more difficult to read. I'm going to keep them in the public blog posts, but the private ones will just have the research information.

#### Notes
- write abstract for Australian Statistical Conference poster and show next week
 
## 2023 March 29
#### General
- The blog site is too big for quarto.pub which is why I had issues publishing my stuff this week :(. 
- I'm not sure if I should move the whole thing somewhere else, or just move the blog.

#### CassowaryR
- I haven't tried the GitLab link from Albrecht yet. I will do that soon.

#### Uncertainty Visualisation
- I did a manic word vomit about visualising uncertainty and my issues with it, its in the blog posts section but you can just use this [link](https://harriet.quarto.pub/posts/uncertaintyisdecisions/).
- I think I am leaning towards making a guide or something on how to visualise uncertainty based on the decision you want to make, not based on the type of data? Similar to the rules we have for normal visualisation? IDK.

#### Comments
- I need to establish ground rules for the next meetings.
- I don't want to do work that will turn out to be obsolete with other work. You keep asking me to zoom in but what if what I wan't to do as my first topic is establish rules for uncertainty visualisation the way we have rules for other visualisation.

## 2023 March 23
#### CassowaryR
- I can't even install the newer version of the package. I have tried using a couple methods and none of them worked.
- Should I email back and say I can't install the package?

#### General
- I think I want to change the direction of my topic a little bit, interesting in everyone's thoughts.

#### Comments
- Sarah is contacting people that I can talk to from AEMO and I should contact Sayani so that I can better understand what their problems are.

## 2023 March 16
#### General
- I added Sarah as a supervisor
- My github actions broke for a bit so my meeting notes weren't updating.

#### Milestone
- I got the reminder email that my milestone is due in 2 months
- I am still not entirely sure what I have to do for it

#### Uncertainty Literature Review
- Have enough reading to start filling out the uncertainty breakdown blog post, found [here](https://harriet.quarto.pub/posts/what_is_uncertainty/).
- Currently adding stuff as we speak

#### CassowaryR
- I have read Alberts email but I haven't checked the new version of interp. I will do that before emailing him back, hopefully before next week.
- He suggested adding random noise, for the long computation issue. The delauney triangulation SHOULD work with colinear points and considering the striated scagnostic literally counts the number of points in a straight line, I am not the biggest fan of that solution. Cassowaryr also already includes jitter for perfectly colinear points (i.e. the straight lines) and while the code runs without error I feel like it opens up some new issues. It means the MST and the hulls the scagnostic are calculated on are not the ones the user sees, and we have already seen that small changes to the triangulation can throw those quite off balance. Plus it now makes it invisible to cassowaryr if points are in a perfectly straight line, and I don't wan't that to be invisible.
- Additionally, if we intend to use cassowaryr for projection persuit where we aren't unitizing the projection every time we calculate the scagnostics, a set amount of random noise will have more effect on some projections than others. 
- He also didn't mention the readability of the C package, nor the scatter plot that had an error, but I will double check those too.
- He showed the different plots for a larger N, which we already knew interp was faster. This might be why he is not keep on swapping packages (excluding the extra work). I wonder if he would be willing to include tRiad as an option (although he might not go for it because it increases his dependencies).

#### Meetings comments and notes
- Additional issue with adding noise in the interp function. Once we add binning to the package and start implementing it, we dont want to be adding noise afterwards. It's a bit weird.
- Can try writing an intermediate function to take the tRiad output and make it look like the interp::tri.mesh() output so tRiad can be seamlessly integrated. 
- Some terms in the uncertainty are a bit odd. Maybe I should write a glossary.
- The forecast display does not make it clear the uncertainty in the model if determined by the residuals of the fitted values. Interesting to see if displaying the fitted values on the forecast makes people see more vs less uncertainty. 


## 2023 March 9

#### General
* Set up github actions so the meeting notes are always up to date.

#### Uncertainty Literature Review
- Just read papers this week, didn't write anything new.

#### CassowaryR
- I fixed the github actions issue, the github actions themselves needed to be updated, it was nothing wrong with the dependencies or code.
- I wrote out a motivation that could be sent to the author of alphahull as to why the swap from interp to tRiad is necessary. It can be found [here](triad/triadswap.qmd)

## 2023 March 2
  
#### General
- I made this website to store information and posts and stuff. It keeps everything together which I like.
  
#### Uncertainty Literature Review
- Finished writing the first blog post and published on this website under [posts](https://harriet.quarto.pub/posts/)
  
#### Experiemnts
- Made a list of [experiment ideas](https://harriet.quarto.pub/research/ideas.html) from the "why people don't visualise uncertainty" topic which is on the website. 
- Added some other experiment ideas for future sections (although I haven't read that much literature on the topics so I am not sure if they are good ideas or not)
  
#### CassowaryR
- Made the hex sticker and added it to the [repo](https://github.com/numbats/cassowaryr) (finally)
- The build and stuff work locally on my computer, but fail in the github actions. They all have the same error and I don't know what it means.
  
#### Meetings comments and notes
- To test if people are more likely to visualise uncertainty if it is set as a default, make two packages for people to visualise uncertainty. One where the default is uncertainty and one where it isn't and see if people just leave the default or if they don't like the uncertainty so much they change it. Would need to do some finessing so it is not obvious it is Robs package.
- To test if including uncertainty is the best way to show the differentiation between the data and the forecast compare uncertainty to other methods of differentiating the forecast. Other methods such as a gap, a change in the line colour, or a change in background colour.
- People are often presented with risk as odds relative to the average (e.g. your area has 3x more cancer cases than the average). Could be good to test this method of conveying odds relative to a population level (60 people in your area of 10 000 have cancer and the average is 20 per 10 000).
- To test the cognative overload of uncertainty, we can show different designs and see how long it takes to answer a question on it. Alternatively we can fix the time and see which plot gives people the most accuracy. Try to find a motivating example. If we want to compare it to not visualising at all and just displaying threshold values, create a ladder of choices or categories, however in general it is hard to quantify continuous uncertainty.
- Energy data may be a good motivating example for the fan vs paths display of forecasting uncertainty. Di emailled it as an RDS.
