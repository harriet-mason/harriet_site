# Supervisor Meetings  
## 2024 September 20 
### Notes 

### Agenda
- Currently working through Susan's feedback (I am 75% of the way through - up to comment 9/12)

- Page Length for The Journal of Statistical Science
  - I couldn't find a max page length in the details, but some I saw some papers that were quite long, one was 36 pages (from 2014). More recent issues had max length of 24 pages (also formatting is different)

- The paper isn't knitting due to an error from Visumap
  - Cynthia also got this error when she tried to knit my progress review slides
  - I updated all my packages before I submit the Cassowaryr paper so I suspect that is what caused it
  - Since it is due to a package update I can either:
    - Revert my package back to when this did not throw an error
      - Can you specify package versions for a quarto document?
    - Make the package pixel map a high priorty and just use my version instead

- I ended up using dibbler to name the package (ggdibbler)

## 2024 September 13  
### Notes 
- Consider where to submit 
- Might be too chatty for Annual Reviews
  - The Journal Of Statistical Science
    - Is length of paper appropriate for the journal
    - if looks like its ok send to Susan coleage
  - Wylie reviews
    - manager is coleage and very passionate about graphics (sort of PhD student of Di)
- Want to keep chatty nature

- Paper notes
  - should have more interesting structure that isnt a target shape
  - e.g. IA shape (e.g. something special about Iowa)
  - Corn sweat (https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/onsite/features/cat.php?day=2022-07-11)
  
- Package
  - not coord, use scale (more appropriate for colour)
  - Look at colour sales (scale_colour_continuous) has option to transform the colour palette on the fly
  - regular gridding vs jittering (subdivide vs position)
    - which one you want to use can depend (might need both as possible option)
  - pixel map irregular shapes
    - n or size inconsistent
    - how to even grid irregular shape
    - can shift to using hex-gridding
    - irregular shapes cause confusion (is shape or data?)
    - hexagons regular shaped
    - irregular shape causes people to think its sub areas (or dot density map)
      - might be able to use standard point process for regular/irregular gridding (https://kevintshoemaker.github.io/NRES-746/sppm.html)

- Package Names
  - Susan name suggestion
    - thorny devil
  - Sarah Suggestions
    - Bustard
    - Nabarlek
    - Gobbleguts
    - Plains-wanderer
  
### Package structure
- Have kind of come up with the structure of how I am going to try and do this
- Have a couple of questions (highlighted in yellow)

![ggsupress structure with ggplot grammar](misc_files/ggstructure.jpg)

### Package Name
- I don't have anything
- I think I have gotten used to calling it `ggsupress` so anything else feels weird
  - Considered `gghedge` but it might make people think of gardening
  - also considered `gguncert` but that feels basic and will probably get confused with `ggdist`

### ToDos
- Setup githup for package and start actually coding it

## 2024 August 30
### ggsuppress
- Input should be original data frame
  - Data needs lat and long (want to be able to glue it into a sf)
- Want to have a stat as well as a geom
  - Stat should have capacity to compute for different representations
  - e.g. mean and st dev for add summary, hexbin, hist has binning
  - inconvinient to do outside dplyr
- Generate data for the package
  - Ask Kate for climate data
  - energy data
  - different simulated data sets with patterns we might need
    - should highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each approach
- Don't call it ggsuppress
  - want something more positive to encourage people to use it


## 2024 August 23
### Notes
### Discussion Topics
#### Lit Review
- Ready to be read
- I am going to stop working on it and wait until you guys have read it and have some suggestions
  - I would honestly prefer a long list of fixes or suggested changes I can work through (you guys are also free to edit the paper)
  - If you have made a suggestion in the past and notice the change hasn't been made, please make the suggestion again, I might have forgotten to add it in
- There are some small changes I think it needs (like adding some additional figures) but I think it would be better to see which parts you guys think need extra explanation/context, rather than spending time adding them in myself.
- I am going to work on the package and cassowaryr stuff until you guys have read the paper.

## 2024 August 8
### Discussion Topics
#### Lit Review / Package

![ggplot extension outputs with their required minimum level of information inputs](misc_files/gginputoutput.jpg)
Have a few questions about this section
- I was adding the data explanation section in the background (as Di suggested) and am not sure which level of data I should be working with
    - I originally just generated the spatial data for illustrative purposes, so I didn't think too much about the analysis process
    - Current state of the data is the estimate & variance level (I had to assume a distribution for the pixel map)
  
- Part of the problem with the existing packages *is* the fact that they all take different inputs so I can't entirely ignore the fact they should all take different data (theoretically)
- Options are
  - Just explain the data as it is (estimate and sampling variance)
  - Start at original data and walk through the process (this might lengthen the paper and its already probably too long)

- Also, is there even an equivalent spatial trend test if you have an estimate and a sampling distribution?
  - I mention it as a potential comparison for evaluation studies
  - Does anyone know any good spatial statistics resources I could skim to find an example of this?
  - Otherwise I can just use each median as a data point but I'm not sure how legitimate that is.

- Additional comment: I feel like a lot of papers get muddled when they use a mean as the estimate, because it is unclear if the variance is the sample variance or estimated population variance. I think I might change our estimate to the median and keep the distribution as the sampling distribution
  - Realistically, there is no reason to have the mean and the population variance, I'm not sure how you could get that without having the original data (in which case you should just show the original data)
  - Sampling distributions make more sense, and using the median makes it clear we are using a sampling distribution

#### Todos
- Lit Review
  - Data stuff mentioned today
    - Fix up data
    - Write up data intro in paper
    - Adjust palettes depending on changes to data
  - Final spell check/read over/format
  - Add/move some figures depending on how sparse the paper looks
  
- Package
  - Read ggplot paper because IDK how to do a ggplot extension
  - Map out space of existing packages (establish that this extension *is* something new)

## 2024 July 26
### Notes
### Discussion Topics
- Did not finish paper last weekend :(
  - Not for a lack of effort, I had more trouble with the palettes than anticipated, but they are ALL good now.
  - I was thinking of just staying up all night to finish it (I really want to be done) but decided I should sleep

- How different is transparency to colour value?
  - Manipulating colour value in R did not make it more white, but like more intense?
  - Instead I made a plot that manipulated Transparency
  - Not sure if this change is OK
  
- Sarah, plz accept the repository colaberation invite

## 2024 July 19
### Notes
- everyone on author list unless they say "no" (so check before submitting)
- instead of IEEE, harvard reviews (check places jessica hullman has published) for length
- ursula about to go on vacation
- Sherry wants to practice c code (huize.zhang@austin.utexas.edu)
- want package
  - have capability to set the scale
  - might not always be scaling down to supress, if you change scale of variance, 
    - good example in patricks thesis (if highest value is higher than the greatest amount it shows nothing)
  - think about signal supression in the other way
    - look at some diverging scales and sequential scales
  - VSUP can think about interactive element (how would this look if the scale was different, and change supression range/colourpalette range)

### Discussion topics
#### Signal Supression Paper
- Have any of you guys had to make a custom legend before? (I think I could work it out but asking might shorten the time it takes significantly)
- What do I do with it when its done?
  - I am 100% finishing it before the next meeting (so we can start discussing the package). 
      - I am just going to work over the weekend to finish if its not done by today. It is not going to bleed into next week.
  - What do I do with it when it is done?
  - How does authorship work? (i.e. whose name do I put on the paper)
- I have a lot of work that is more "theoretical" (i.e. no experiment or software associated with it), and I've seen a lot of this kind of theoretical stuff in IEEE. Therefore it doesn't necessarily have to be considered a "literature review" and I think I'll try submitting to IEEE if Annual Reviews rejects it.
  - e.g. I think the signal suppression paper is similer to [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1626178?casa_token=vO_VMcgDIIwAAAAA:hqDzh8H9yxav2_boprgZSZBsub3RFK5EoKMSQUvTrSPBJDLiRo4m4pUbshHtDNFa_3QhaehPeLQ) and even though its a short paper I've seen plenty of longer papers that also fit the bill
  - No cost to submitting somewhere. If its rejected I get feedback (which is good) and if its accepted I have a paper (which is also good). 
    
#### cassowaryr (mostly for Di)
- Monday next week I'm going to check the Cassowaryr package runs the paper without issue
  - If it runs without issue I will submit the new version to CRAN and we can submit the R-journal paper
  - If it doesn't run I will probably split next week 50/50 

#### ggplot extension
- My current plan is to go through the existing uncertainty vis packages and work out where the gaps are
  - There are quite a few, i.e. ggdist, several bivariate packages, 
  - They all take in different inputs, most of them don't interact with ggplot, they consider uncertainty visualisation its own independent plot and are not looking at "adjusting" an existing plot such that it shows uncertainty

- I want the end result of the package to be a "supression" version of existing ggplot2 geoms
  - e.g. `ggplot(data) + geom_sf_sup(aes(fill = estimate, fill_unc = variance), method="pixel")`
    - this code would replace each estimate value with a sample from a $N(estimate, variance)$ distribution
    - Makes it easy replace existing code with an uncertainty version
    - This method also allows us to expand the concept into different types of plots later (since every plot technically could have an "uncertainty" counterpart but some of them would be a complete mess)
    
- I am also planning to to look at the limitations of using things like VSUP, what would be required, etc. The ggplot method I am thinking about is viewing each estimate in isolation, I am not sure how weird combination methods would work.

#### AEMO control room operator meeting
- This week I had a 3h Meeting with an AEMO control room operator where she went through her job, what she wants out of it
- She does not want uncertainty plots, I actually agree that they will not help her at all. 
- The people that manage uncertainty (handbook writers, forecasters, etc) do not make decisions. They only use the uncertainty to determine thresholds that maxmise stabilist. The people that make decisions only see thresholds and do not engage with uncertainty as all.
- the operator was adamant that she does not want *even more* information. A lot of her job is knowing proceedures. As a matter of fact, the closer we can get her work environment to the rational agent model (i.e. only informing her when thresholds are hit with attetion drawing colour coded notifications) the happier she said she would be. 

- This is actually how a rational agent (which we should assume AEMO wants to be) *should* manage uncertainty.
- I used to have a whole section in the annual reviews paper that I took out and pasted togehter as its own paper. (I am not suggesting this as a new paper, I'm saying I already wrote it out as it was a direct follow up from my confirmation/annual reviews work)
  - **Main idea of the paper**: If there is any scenario where the utility function of the agent is known, then there is a decision that optimises that utility, and there should never be a plot. Uncertainty visualisations are only necessary for decision making tasks where:
    1) the agent making the decision is using a utility function that is unknown to 
    2) the agent who has the information and is making the plot. 
  This premise is built on pretty straightforward logic from the definition of a rational agent. A rational agent, by definition, is maximizing a utility function (the uncertainty on that utility function has no effect on the rational agent unless it creates bias in their decision and means their decisions are not optimal). A rational agent is simply a mathematical process, so there is no need for a plot. 
- For example, AEMO does not care about unpredictable weather affecting their demand estimates in isolation. There is no reason for AEMO to care about that as demand is not the function they are trying to optimise. AEMO is trying to minimise the probability of a blackout (this is a simple example, the operator told me about some stability function they do). Therefore, AEMO only cares about how the increase volatility in demand affects the probability of a blackout. So AEMO uses that variance as an input to decide the threshold as which the operator would need to start doing something (like shedding energy or something). The operator does not care what caused the change in the threshold, they only care about what the threshold is. The forecasters do not care about the uncertainty for its own sake, only in so far as it affects the probability of a blackout. If the operator was given discretion for action (with an uncertainty visualisation) and the optimization function is known (which AEMO does know) then we would reach an inoptimum solution. 

- I actually think this paper would be more useful to AEMO than another of the other stuff I have done. It explains why the best approach to improve stability is to reduce the noise in the cognitive process of the operator. Giving the operator uncertainty displays would result in decisions that are not optimal. 
    - It is highly relevant to their business practice and aligns well with the "wish list" of the operator which includes things like: 
      - If there are planned line maintenance, so they are going to be down, put them in the system so I am not alerted to them
      - colour coded traffic light system for screening key indices that relfect the health of the entire system
      - linking between software ("I should be able to right click on the power grid having the issue and open up the respective location in the market management software. Instead I have to look at its code and go find it in this long list, set the date, etc)




## 2024 June 21
#### Notes

#### Discussion topics
- Did 3MT, I hate that competition haha.

- Signal-supression paper stuff
  - Update
    - I have tried to restructure the paper so that it is focused on the signal-suppression idea
    - Previously I felt comfortable calling it a review because it did review the literature but slowly arrived at the signal suppression conclusion
    - Now it is more of an argument for a different approach to uncertainty visualisation
      - The literature review sections
        1) set the scene for why the different approach is novel, and
        2) provide examples of conflicting literature that disappears when we view uncertainty visualisation through this lense
  - Questions
    - I am not sure how early I should introduce the concept of "signal-suppression". 
    - Should I re-title the paper?
    - I am not sure if the three main points go together, the paper basically goes
      1) Why is uncertainty special? (goes through motivations of the subfield existing at all)
      2) What is an uncertainty visualisation? (discuss definitions of uncertainty, definitions of uncertainty visualisation, and why uncertainty visualisation doesnt work with my definition and EDA? It's kinda messy and the direction of this section isn't clear)
      3) How do you evaluate uncertainty visualisations? (talks about how to measure signal-supression instead of signal)
      

- Should I change the term "signal-suppression"?
  - I don't think it is sending the vibe I want
  - I called it signal-supression because if you dont include uncertainty information, both valid and invalid signals would be clear. The only signal that a good signal-supression plot should hide is statistically *invalid* signals.
  - I think signal supression gives the idea that we are hiding information, but actually what we are trying to do is design visualisations such that when you *include* the uncertainty information signals that actually arent there are supressed. We are only supressing erroneous signal

## 2024 June 14 
#### Notes
- Can rethink signal supression with rescaling
  - e.g. use 1 as a benchmark and values lower than 1 you sharpen the image (or more concentrated colour) and the higher than 1 matches what we are currently doing
  - similar vein adjusting way we visualise estimate based on uncertainty
- Cast study: cancer atlas changing the way they visualise uncertainty from transparency to removing it (and having the option to use it as a different variable)
  - prevent combination of two variables (although maybe not anymore)
  - Turning on and off transparency layer (interactive element consideration)
- Signal supression hard to colourlind people 
  - Mutes colours towards similar hard to distinguish colours
- Racial dot map could make a nice natural comparison point
  - using other principals that let you combine the amount of colour
- could have section to talk about other areas of interest
  - bits that are relevant uncertainty vis but not main idea but still might need to be included
- People seem to be uncomfortable with the concept of "signal-supression"
  - We are not trying to supress singal, but rather provide more information so that you dont draw erroneous signal and are more certain about the signal you do draw
  - Like with chat-GPT how it needs to give you an answer no matter what (even if it has no idea what it is doing), this communication method is trying to prevent that type of message
  - Maybe calling it something else would be better. I think signal supression gives the idea that we are hiding information, but actually what we are trying to do is design visualisations such that when you *include* the uncertainty information signals that actually arent there are supressed.
  
#### Discussion topics
- 3MT next week. Slide is made and speech is written.
- AMSI talk follow new structure of presentation. Going to use it as a baseline for restructuring the paper.
- Suggestions from milestone panel (and other attendees)
  - Chapter 1 Suggestions
    1) Need to make it clear that viewing uncertainty visualisation through the lens of signal supression is the main idea of the paper
      - Currently it is introduced halfway through the paper. 
      - Rest of paper should also be directly related to that main idea
    2) Need to make some specific elements clearer
      - Advantages/disadvantages of approaching uncertainty visualisation from the signal supression perspective
      - Make it clearer when signal should and should not be supressed and *why* we may or may not want to supress signal in specific circumstances
    3) I'm not exactly sure what was meant by "How might the existing contributions in the literature on uncertainty visualisation be better
organised, to separate out the different types or aspects of uncertainty?". Do you guys know or should I ask?
  - Chapter 2 Suggestions
    1) Make it clear what functionality would be added to ggplot
      - What are the inputs/outputs
      - How is it different to existing ggplot tools
    2) Make it clear the situations where this ggplot extension/wrapper would be useful

## 2024 May 16
#### Notes
- want to get feedback from commitee on whether the scope of the overview is sufficient/complete
  - are there any holes
  - need to explain what is in the paper suscinctly so comittee can get an idea of what is in it so they can provide feedback
- also want to get feedback on whether the next steps make sense to work on
  - so also need to explain them 
  - why they are interesting to do in particular
- example of the iowa map is good to go into detail in the presentation to explain why the next two chapters are needed
  - keep conceptual framework that it doenst matter what you have none of them can handle this very well
- posit conf sign up for this year online (free) and last years talks are on youtube

## 2024 May 9
#### Notes
- Draft of report by Friday
- Map adjustments
  - white outline on palette
  - signal and uncertainty axis
  - Comment on why we can still see the signal in the bivariate map method

#### Discussion topics
- Current task
  - I have been going back through the paper and cutting it down very agressively 
- Next tasks
  - After this I am going to finish fixing up the images (I still have some in my drawings that have not been added in, or figures that I haven't fixed up from previous meetings)
  - After that I'm going to Fixing up formatting issues
  - After that I'm writing up the plan for topics 2 and 3
- Most of my figures are actually in the "great examples" section. To better disperse the figures throughout the paper, I could have the great examples littered throughout?
- 2nd topic working out map uncertainty details, 3rd topic experiment
  - Trying to get maps on the same scale was a nightmare and it didn't even work. There visualisation methods are poorly defined so its hard to work out how you should translate between them
  - Already have notes for the experiment written up, just need to add to them.
- Bump on letter for AMSI

## 2024 April 30
#### Notes
- Map visualisation
  - might be going to far out, paper is already pretty long
- EDA vs Communication
  - Eda is that we dont know what we are looking for, communication is that we do, visualisation does not make that distinction clear.
- Grammar of graphcis
  - Only working in finite spaces
  - Main difference is knowing the underlying distribution vs not
- Map Visualisaitons
  - rmapshaper thin the maps before using them to decrease the resolution
  - maps are huge because made for cartogophers
  - better off picking something that has been used for the pixel maps, such as the california area
  - can get directly from R, maps has US counties data, can directly get California (and hope its up to date)
  - already thinned 
  - would have to look at maps package to figure out how to extract the data
  
## 2024 April 23
#### Notes
- Grammar of grpahics pipeline
  - add population that generates "true" visualisation (two separate things)
  - in theory passes through the same pipeline therefore dont need all the assumptuons (messy) like two pipelines
  - change descriptive statistic to observed statistic
- Extract vs Decision
  - vague acutally is quantitative mispecified question
  - decision = quantitative precise decision
  - too busy and too much detail - want to put in visual if its going to save from reading two pages
  - why not worthwhile
    - summarising a handful of experiments, some of which are not well done. Should be written in the paper, but may not need a whole figure
    - Suggests different levels of uncertainty that can be confounded
    - don't get bogged down, ask "is this the most important thing to empahasis?" deserves a paragraph or a few sentences
- Hypothesis test vis
  - sherry time series
    - bootstrapped entire time series not individual statistics therefore confidence interval can be done for invidivual values
    - null plot would be hard to do and for entire plot
    - pointwise can remove trend (bootstrapped)
    - if test, would be different if visualised in one way or another
    - does it break it in one place or everywhere, control factor for an experiment
    - choose plots that let you 

#### Discussion topics
- Added hand drawn images


## 2024 April 16
#### Notes
- What type of uncertainty is not displayed in the plot
- What are the summary statistics of spatial data
- link whatever experiment back to the literature review

#### Discussion topics
- The [ASMI summer school](https://ws.amsi.org.au/) is on mathematical uncertainty under decision making (2 weeks in Queensland). It looks useful. What is the procedure for going to something like this?
- I wrote down a couple of ideas [here](misc_files/futureideas.qmd)

## 2024 April 9
#### Notes
- Come up with mini proposals for future thesis topics to discuss at next meeting
  - Think about how you might tackle it
- Figures
  - Definition taxonomy citation gap
  - Think about a diagram that would help understand the information in the paragraph
  - Sequence of diagrams through the whole paper that tell the story of the paper
- Email about milestone

#### Discussion Topics
- Literature review draft
  - Fixing up figures
  - Data pipeline for grammar of graphics section
- Susan said I should be aware of some unpublished work Heike has been working on, specifically she said:
  - "Email Heike and ask if she has any draft papers about her work with NORC and testing graphics in the general population. She'll know what you're talking about."
  - Is this email OK? I feel weird cold emailing people.
- I entered 3MT (I have already written the talk so its not a time issue) just thought I should mention it.

## 2024 March 12
#### Notes
- Put some reasons we care about uncertainty in introduction
- Decision making: make sure you mention that there is a wider purpose to it

#### Current Stage
- Still working on the rewrite to make it readable. I have had a few suggestions from Susan that I am also incorperating. 
- I have about half of the paper left to do. 
- After this stage, I would be happy for you guys to read it so I can get your thoughts. Although if you feel really strongly about anything below (in the next stages section) being included you can also wait for that.

#### Questions
- I am not sure how to include a history of uncertainty visualisation in the introduction.

#### Next Stages
The next steps for the paper are:

1) There are several sections marked with a (*Cite Gap #*), which represents something I have a citation for but I will need to go and find it. After the rewrite is done, I am going to fill in these cite gaps.

2) Update the images to be my own r-coded images.

3) Go back to some papers I didn't get to (or have been sent by you guys e.g. the missing values visualisation paper) and read + include that information. I will just be adding these into the existing structure so it shouldn't take as long as organising the original papers.

4) Add in intended & clean up existing hand drawn images

5) Final checks

## 2024 February 28 (with Susan)

#### Literature Review Main Ideas

- Uncertainty does not have a strict definition
  - It needs a mathematical definition
  - There is widespread misunderstanding within the literature as to what uncertaitny actually is and create nonsensical visualisations (because how something has uncertainty in the visualisation case is unclear)
  - Uncertainty should be defined in terms of inference and how steps along the analysis pipeline influence (each step creates bias or variance)

- The class of "uncertainty visualisation" is not defined 
  - This is likely a run on problem from the definition problem
  - The uncertainty visualisation literature is impossible to organise and there is no attempt to design field wide visualisation rules (noted by several other)
  - Experiments compare visualisations with vastly different mathematical information as though they are equivalent, and when the mathematical information is the same the visualisations differ according to perceptual task. Because of this, the results of many uncertainty visualistion experiments are self evident. If you organise the visualisations according to the statistics and aesthetics they use to convey information, the results of the papers are easily predicted by using established concepts such as the perceptual hierarchy. 

- Authors do not know what makes uncertainty visualisation interesting
  - Again, this is an extension of the previous two points
  - Most author justify uncertainty visualisation as its own field, separate from normal visualisation, citing the psychological nature of uncertainty and/or the dimensionality problem
  - This is also disconnected from the motivation behind uncertainty visualisation, since authors quote that they should visualise uncertainty because failing to do so is tantamount to fraud 
  - This means uncertainty is not special because it is an extension of the dimensionality problem or for psychological reasons, but because it is supposed to supress signal
  - The current uncertainty literature is repeating information visualisation experiments because by directly asking participants to report a value (such as a variance or a probability) turns those values into the signal of the visualisation
  - This means you cannot measure the effectiveness of noise by directly asking about it

- Noise is hard to measure
  - Need a way to measure noise for evaluation studies
  - Current methods to capture uncertainty without resorting to value extraction are: trust/confidence in visualisation, decision making metrics, and vague questions that imply the participant needs to somehow combine uncertainty and signal. Each of these measurement methods have huge drawbacks or are based on invalid assumptions.
  - Alternative options to try and measure noise are things like barely noticiable differences, i.e. showing participants plots with decreasing noise and and identifying when they are able to identify the signal. This is similar in concept to the lineup stuff.
  - Visualisation is a particularly difficult a visualisation can convey several signals at once, and often the most popular visualisations are the most versatile (e.g. a scatter plot ). 
  - The choice of ground truth is also hard (specifically for visualisation) because there is no clear rules for exactly when a signal should become noticeable in a plot. Patrick's PhD work shows that human perception does not perfectly line up with standard statistical tests.
  - I have an idea of a solution for the other problems, not so much this one lol.

  
## 2024 February 27
### Notes
- Give Susan copy of paper, and explain general idea and flow
  - want to refine paper in its current state to get it to a final version.
- min max for decision making (relevant information)
- redo all visualisations in own style referring to the original visual that inspired it.
- read data pipeline things and make own data pipeline visualisation (where uncertainty comes in at each step)

### Uncertainty Literature Review

##### Update
![Paper Bins explained](misc_files/27febprogress.jpeg)

  
- I have now finished the word vomit. I am now going back through the paper and adding citations and moving paragraphs around so it is cohesive (and cutting long winded paragraphs where I am rambling that should be one sentence). 
- I think it should be readable (to a point where the feedback you guys give is something I wasn't already planning on fixing myself) once it is at the end of this timeline.  

##### Questions
- The overlap between the "general" problems in uncertainty visualisation and the visualisation specific ones is quite large. I was thinking of keeping the earlier sections quite brief and moving a large part of those sections to the literature review section. 
  - As it is now, I basically start getting going with a point, and then I have to stop to move onto the next section. I feel like its a bit jerky with how it reads.  
  - With this, I am now not sure how much of the "background" to include in the introduction. Maybe this is a question for when the draft is done.  
- Each citation for the point I am trying to make is long winded (show an example) where I am explaining what the author was trying to do but also why it makes the mistake I am discussing. I am not doing a full data analysis, but I want to give the sensation that these issues I'm discussing are *everywhere*. I am not quite sure how much information I need to give for context in each example. 
  - I was thinking of having examples in the appendix too, so that I can have a few in the body text, but if readers want more they want. I really want to give the sense of how overwhelming and widespread the things I'm talking about are.  


## 2024 February 13
### Notes
- Not responsible for doing a data analysis, am responsible to make sure I am covering the field fairly
- Check other papers to see how they collected evidence and see what is acceptable from them
- Ideally papers that lay out the landscape of a particular area (not all the papers in that journal are doing that so make sure to check)

### Paper Boxes
This week I want to have a conversation about the big picture of the thesis. I also have a couple of changes I want to make to meetings.

I think it would be a good chance to discuss the broad overview of my thesis so we can all be on the same page and you guys know what my goals are for each section. The chapters I have in mind are:

  1) Literature Review: Spell out problems and show how prevalent they are by quantifying how common issues are across a variety of papers and diciplines.
  
  2) Define Uncertainty: Provide a formal mathematical definition of uncertainty. A mathematical definitions of uncertainty that is consistent across all levels of the data analysis pipeline would be quite compliated. It would need to unify things like confidence intervals, prediction intervals, missing data, biased samples, etc. I do have something in mind but it is not in a position where it is ready to be discussed and I worry that reading it might stress you out. If you want to keep updated on that work and see what the concept I am trying to define is, I have been collecting my ideas [here](https://harriet.quarto.pub/ideas/posts/defininguncertainty/). I know this is a paper in of itself because the "defining uncertainty" paper that decried the taxonomy is its own paper with like 2000 citations and this definition would be more thorough than that.
  
  3) Define Uncertainty Visualisation: Using the maths definition of uncertainty we can then insert it into the grammar of graphics framework to have an actual definition for uncertainty visualisations that can be used to describe uncertainty visualisations.
  
  4) Experimental Signal Suppression: Discuss ways to test noise as noise rather than testing noise as signal, using the formalised uncertainty definitions. This would be for a spatial/temporal context.
  
![Paper Bins explained](misc_files/paperbins.jpg)

I have done a very large amount of work on the other topics that seem like they are part of the literature review, but should actually be papers in of themselves. The literature review would be far too long if I included all these things. I think with these sections I have enough for a full thesis. 

I think the confirmation had a small amount of all the topics, but none of them were developed enough to be their own competent ideas, over the past several months this has changed.

![The timeline for me writing something up](misc_files/WORKFLOW.jpg)

Ideally my progress review will be the literature review and the completed mathematical definition of uncertainty. 

### Meetings
I *am* getting very good advice from you guys, but that is exactly the problem. The advice is good which makes me want to immediately jump to that section of my workflow or to that paper. I struggle a lot to forcibly shift myself back to a main task once I have swapped which means I am leaving everything half finished and using a lot of energy to try and get back on topic. I have a habit of getting distracted and I am trying to prevent that.  

- The meetings have been fine, I just want to make one small change.  
- I want to meet when I have specific questions (which usually happens every 1-2 weeks anyways) and avoid having "check-in" meetings.   
- If I don't have a specific question I will cancel the meeting for that week. I collect my questions as I go so I can give you as much notice for a cancelled meeting as you need.   
- This will also prevent me from going down rabbit holes because I got good advice that I want to investigate.  
- This will also give you a clear idea on what I am seeking feedback on which would make it easier for me to implement and also you don't have to try and keep up to date on a huge mess of work (I can ask you to read specific sections)

### Supervision Team
I think the supervision team has four people that think about visualisation and uncertainty very differently to me and we are struggling with translation between our perspectives. I don't think either way of thinking is wrong, but sometimes I struggle to understand your feedback or how it fits into what I am talking about. I think including Susan in some of our conversations would be helpful because she seemed to understand both perspectives and talking to her helped me translate previous feedback you guys had given me into something I understood and could implement. 

![Difference In ideas](misc_files/difthink.jpg)

### Evidence for the Literature Review
- Not totally sure what counts as "evidence"
- Tabling up the papers and collecting them as data, will allow me to show that the comments I am making about these papers are perverse and not just a once off.
- Seems like this might take a long time
- I can change the plot collection to the grammar of graphics, but I need to finish reading the book to proper understand and apply it. 

## 2024 February 6
### Notes
- add typology of uncertainty table to stuff
- consider doing a clustering of the abstracts to see common threads using [tidytext](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) instead of manually organising them
- cake sprinkles were confusing to Sarah so make it uniform
- Sarah had a student do a summary and draw boxes (get link for paper)

### Lit Review
#### Work summary, questions, comments, and edits
- I added images to the definition section, I have marked the general attitudes section as done but it does need images to be added
- I also added in a paragraph about why there is not mathematical definition of uncertainty, as well as a section explaining *why* we should consider uncertainty this way instead of the way we typically consider it (similar to the stuff I said to Sarah last week)
- I read up on the grammar of graphics, and I realized my confirmation was kinda me trying to do this but for uncertainty visualisation (whoops)
  - The grammar of graphics doesn't quite seem to capture some differences in uncertainty visualisation that seem to be of importance. I think I will convert the stuff I was trying to say in my confirmation into a grammar of graphics framework so it actually makes sense.
  - I think my problem with a lot of the uncertainty visualisation stuff is that they all use the same data and axis scales, but every other aspect (the statistics,the elements, the coordinates, everything) is a complete free for all.

## 2024 January 23
#### Lit Review
##### Meeting Notes
- Groups
  - Bundle the other categories together and mention other considerations
- Task Hierarchy
  - consider arguing that you are thinking about it with respect to the taxonomy
  - Look into Q methodology process
  - Recording too many details for each paper will make it become too complicated. Try to keep it simple.
- Range of papers
  - Don't expand the range of the paper by too much
  - Do include papers that talk about visualisation of confidence intervals or density/distribution visualisations
  - Try not to get too fine grained on the critique particularly, keep open mind when writing the first parts,
  - Nod to other papers that are included according to the definition (such as missing value visualisations) but don't do a full literature review on them
- Extra notes
  - In the future work, discuss the possibility of mapping uncertainty work to the hierarchies established is drawing graphics
- Todo's
  - Write summary for each section (i.e. paper groups) and mark parts to come back to with finer details.
  - Find good examples of uncertainty visualisation and explain why they are good 
    - (the trust papers highlight the noise signal thing too)

##### Groups
- Paper groups:
  - Plot comparisons, Perceptual tasks, Heuristic Checks, Trust Assessment, Meta Papers on the experiment design, Qualatative analysis, Can people get X from a plot?

- I am not 100% sure on how to integrate the groups that aren't plot comparisons
  - Plot experiemnts: does this pdf visualisation do better than this pdf visaulisation
  - Perceptual tasks: Do people associate this visual aesthetic with uncertainty? (these experiments apply to a specific sub-area of uncertainty visualisation where the uncertainty is integrated in the aesthetic used to visualise the signal variable)
  - Heuristic checks: do people have this bias when looking at this plot?
  - Trust assessments: Do people trust our results more with this uncertainty visualisation? (The weird asusmption that trust should be treated as independent from the trustworthiness of the information is wild)
  - Meta papers: Uncertainty visualisation experiments should actually be done like this.
  - Qualatative analysis: Look at this visualisaiton for this purpose, tell us what you are looking at and why.
  - Can people get X: Draw/look at this uncertainty viusalisation, what is the mean of this distribution?

- Some papers combine multiple of these types but these seem to be the broad categories. All my comments do not apply to every type of paper so I am not 100% sure how to compile them.

##### Task hierarchy
- Basically my logic is:
  - Most uncertainty papers visualise uncertainty as a PDF and directly ask questions about the "probablity of event x"
  - This is treating uncertainty as a signal not as a noise. In this case, there is no reason to treat uncertainty as any different from another variable. Therefore, if you apply the logic of established results from visual inference (not specific to uncertaitny) the results of a lot of these papers are self evident. 
  - The papers I have read seem to have results that align with this theory but I need a way to show it that is more than just "vibes" which is what I currently have.

- I want to use a kind of hierarchy but it is hard to find one. This is what I was trying to do with the taxonomy of visual informatio I presented at last years confirmation. I wanted to show that any visual statistic can be related to the mathematical statistic, and then you can show with maths the statistics you have in a visualisation and how difficult they are to pull out. The product plots paper made a similar point which is why I was interesting in trying to use it. Basically a significant statistics thing for visualisation. While that might have worked, I can't use that in the literature review because it isn't a published paper, so I need something that is citable. 
- Frankly from what I have done so far, it looks like people will do whatever "elementary task" is closest to what you are asking for by default. If you ask them to make an effort they will do an elementary task + a heuristic at most. If the heuristic is bad or is doing too much leg work, the responses are bad. This is also something I can't use but it is currently how I am organsing the information.
- I have an example of this in the excel spreadsheet. I also want to go through what I am tracking and why to see if there is anything that might be a waste of time.

- The hierarchy options I have at the moment are:
  - [Susans graphic](https://srvanderplas.github.io/Presentations/2023-12-ASC/#/testing) which is more about testing methods and also I don't know if it is published anywhere.
  - I could try doing something that is more qualitative where I discuss how cognitively difficult something would be based on the best practices from [this paper](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-statistics-031219-041252)
  - [This paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09637214211009512) talks about different ways we get information out of a graphic but they don't really talk about which is easier or anything. The author themselves says it would be useful to know the relative power of these visual tools.
  - [This paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21292539/) is kind of relevant when looking at sample visualisations, but this has a similar problem to the one above where it is more of a discussion of the visual systems rather than a direct comparison of how difficult some tasks are.

- If I can show THIS is true, the my greater point of "If you want to treat uncertainty as a signal you can look to other visualisation research, if you want to treat uncertainty as a noise there is very little in terms of discussion or established methods" which is the background for the experiment I want to do.
  - I actually think the lineup protocol or open ended questions are the only ways you could really ask about noise. It kind of feels like trying to catch a breath in a jar or something.
  
##### Range of Papers
- Up to now I have basically been exclusively looking at papers that have they keywords "uncertainty visualisation" or something similar. Should I also expand my search/considerations to:
  - Papers that talk about visualising distributions/densities or probabilies specifically (since this is what the uncertainty visualisation papers as basically doing anyways)
  - Papers that talk about visualization of missing values
  - Other things that can introduce uncertainty as stated in my definition of uncertianty that dont explicity use the key word "uncertainty"

## 2024 January 9
#### Meeting comments
- where could my work (or someone elses) from a mathematical perspective make some inroads that would fix this problem (dont have to give a fix)
- what would be a practical consideration, 
- what would be the statistical aspects (
  - including assumptions we are asking people to make in order to make a judgement) 
  - why it makes sense to assume the storm is constant size and intensity for the cone paper, 
- what would be the mathematical elements of the uncertainty (cone gives sense that outside the cone you are safe) 
  - what should people know in preparation for a storm 
  - what would I like to know? i.e. what is the chance it is going to hit me, if i wait an hour where is the storm going to be and will I still have time to evacuate)
- papers on uncertainty do a poor job of displaying uncertainty themselves (what were the measurements taken how was standard error calculated)

#### Uncertainty Lit Review
- I have skipped straight to the experiment section.
- Had notes for all the experiments but I have had to go back in and summarise them in terms of the specific information i need for the lit review.
  - The list of items I am summarising for each paper (so that I can also quantify some of these things) is in the literature review
- I am not sure I want to avoid the papers that are "bad" because they aren't technically "bad" they are more confused and that is part of the point. 
  - The parts that are a yes/no in the summary list are easy, the general confusion and conflicting assumptions/ground truths are not as easy to capture
  - Also when there are a LOT fo conflicting assumptions even the easy parts of the paper become difficult to summarise down. 
  - Working out how they diverge and why is becoming time consuming. I am thinking I should just cut my losses with some papers for now. I'm worried that will add a bias towards statistics paper into the lit review though.
  - I feel like this is stemming from the deeper problem which comes from the uncertainty definition problem which isn't their fault but does need to be addressed. Like if the people writing the papers who are experts are struggling to untangle uncertainty I don't know why we expect the participants to get it right.
- I want to go through one of the papers that I have categorized according to the lit review (cont of uncertainty paper) and talk about how to discuss it in a nice way
  - Some parts are easy (especially issues that overlap with a lot of papers) but issues in assumptions (that are quite common in the papers but don't follow a consistent pattern) are harder.

## 2024 January 4
#### Meeting comments
- mid year deadline for projection pursuit paper (july 1st deadline for submitting a draft)
  - scagnostics 
  - new student for math bit

#### Experiment
- Can I add Susan as a supervisor? Might be too many people.
- I want to test a specific case of uncertainty visualisation, but I have several small hypothesis in what I think would make a good visualisation
  - Visualisation goal is signal suppression instead of signal (most papers are on uncertainty as signal, i.e. "how likely is this outcome")
  - Embed uncertainty within the same variable that it exists in when possible to maintain source (geography people care about it)
  - Mass vs Sample for simulation vs estimated/assumed (since a mass is just a sample as n->inf)
  - Resolution (e.g. box plot vs density) is for macro vs micro trends, akin to bin width in a histogram. 
- I started looking at an example to show how this would work (in spatial case study post) but then I remembered I should finish the literature review

#### Uncertainty Lit Review
- Sections are organised, I am going through and writing the draft. I am hoping it will be ready for a check next week.
- Set up github repo [here](https://github.com/harriet-mason/ARSA-UncertaintyLitReview)

## 2023 November 28
#### Meeting
- Still need to organise how frequent each meeting is.

#### Cassowaryr
- Will email Albrecht when the site is back up and running since I wrote up the issue as a page on the website like last time. It is not urgent enough for me to move it somewhere else, but If the website bug isn't fixed before I go to ASC I'll just rewrite it as a bug on the cassowaryr github and email him before I leave.

#### Uncertainty Lit Review
- I am still trying to get the draft of this done within the month of November
- I culled down and organised the sections of the confirmation report, and read over
- There are several sections that need to be "beefed up" a little, (such as what is considered to be uncertainty in the literature) so I am currently taking notes from the papers I have half read to transfer to the literature review.
- Once I have the notes I'll probably move over and finish the poster for ASC and then move back to this
- I want to have the draft done before I go to the conference

#### Poster
- I have made notes on what it needs to cover based on my abstract but have not started the design since I was going to adapt the literature review.
- I didnt add you guys to the original submission by mistake, can I add everyone as co-authors on the poster and lightning talk slide or is it too late for that since you aren't in the program?
- Cynthia said she would print it when she is in Sydney

#### Notes
- try using chull package instead for convex hull

## 2023 November 16
#### BEX6510 
- I think I did OK
- The assignment is [here](https://harriet.quarto.pub/ideas/posts/productplots/) and I could use it as a jumping off point for work further down the line

#### AEMO
- Email from Michael Dalton on Nov 3rd (I forgot about it until now)
- Suggested I use their new data analysis as a new point of contact

#### IEEVIS
- I got some good advice at the poster session
  - Tamara Munzner gave me some suggestions and a list of relevant papers she thought I should read and thought it looked like it could be really interesting
  - she also told me to ping her if I couldn't find the papers she mentioned when talking to her
- I was going to work on this following the literature review (which I am working on after the cassowaryr stuff is done)

#### Cassowaryr
- Presented at R-ladies and in trying to get the exaples working I found a series of new errors.
- Detailled those issues are detailled [here](triad/cassowaryrcheck.qmd)

#### Notes
- make NA as cassowaryr output to make it clear it doesnt make sense (alphahull calculations)
- just email now
- think about experiment
- make fictional scenario to avoid people bringing in bias
- Ursula more cassowaryr 

## 2023 October 12
#### BEX6510 Assignment + Notes
- Could make the cascade plot interactive (would need to use shiny)
  - Step 1 would be animation showing each individual one
    - So long as they slot over each other
  - to make interactive would need user interface so people can choose what to
- alternative statistical tests
- continuous in one direction equvalent plots
- add in uncertainty (?)
  - needs to come from statistical base thing
  - should try simulating from distributions (bernouli, multinomial) will get multiple data sets and can to find a representation of uncertainty
    - can also calculate theoretical ones (but end up with mainly means and std)
    - everything needs to add up to be correct according to the product plot things
    - replotting multiple times (field of those) - eaier than rejigging boundaries and stuff
  - look at proportion/count plots uncertainty methods (dynamite plots)
-   Does this work extend to expected values or visualisations of other mathematical process?
-   Could be expanded by looking at which other perceptual tasks are combinations of others
-   extension to continuous case
-   Can the questions be combined similarly the way we can combine the PMF and the graphics
-   Connections between formal statistical tests and visualisations
-   uncertainty visualisation extensions
-   other geometric measures (curvature)
  
## 2023 October 5
#### Uncertainty Vis
- Christoph emailed back but I'm not sure how relevant their project will be. Their main uncertainty focus seems to be on computing uncertainty rather than visualising it (which could be its own interesting case study I guess).
  - I am not 100% sure what to say to them in this case
- I drafted an email response to Corrina

#### BEX6510
- Am I supposed to discuss the assignment with you at all or not? I am really not sure what the deal with the assignment is.
- I think I am going to have to pause meetings until after the exam because I am *stressed* about the unit. 
  - Not getting the lecture notes before the semester started was a bad move, but I actually think Bonsoo is making them as we go so I'm not sure if I would have been able to get them before the semester started anyways.
  
#### Notes
- email hadley/check github for the products plots code
- related package haley jeppson ggmosaic
- split into data aggreation and geometry mapping

## 2023 September 21

#### Notes
- Email Corrina to chat about project (don't need to understand it). Add that we have a meeting at this time.
- Email wind guys again.
- Check other lit review papers for format
- IEEVIS sunday before energy vis workshop 9am 22nd Oct. Week before another monash specific meeting.
- Look up eyeballing for statistics papers. Susan Vanderplas stuff, should be able to point to other things that are similar, usually people are given a plot before.

#### Uncertainty Vis
##### Case Studies
- I never heard back from those wind guys. 
- I read the stuff linked in the Corrina email. I think some of the jargon confused but I am keen to hear about the case studies she has.

##### Literature Review
- I decided it would be easier to just finish the literature review instead of starting something else to add on (like doing the method analysis) since I have all the pieces (a lot of stuff from my confirmation). I can always do the method analysis later, plus I think writing down all the stuff I have read will give a better foundation for additional work. 
- Plus after watching [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0QMKFzW9fw) I kind of wanted to write a research supported guideline for uncertainty visualisation hahahaha
- Once the cassowaryr stuff is sorted I'm going to take the relevant parts of the confirmation and build a draft of the literature review.

#### Interp
- Does paper and package examples run? Yeah. I wrote up the gist of what has and hasn't changed with the addition of the jitter [here](triad/interpcheck.qmd).

#### Random Question
- Do you guys know of any papers where the data inference went in the opposite direction? Like statisticians were given the results of several tests and asked to draw the data. It makes me think of police sketches never resembling the person (apparently interviewing is important).

## 2023 August 31
#### IEEEVIS
- I have some poster drafts I made in powerpoint (I couldn't figure out canva)

#### AEMO
- Emailled Christoff group
- Haven't read Corinna email yet

#### BEX6510
- Need to pick a paper for the week 12 assignment.

#### Notes
- Poster needs to stand on its own (most people won't read the paper)
- Di has a resource on the best way to strcutre a poster
- about BEX paper: email bonsoo cc di and sarah: use this exercise as a literature review and still discuss the pros and cons of each paper (add background - more beneficial for research progress). Also ask about 10 page summary (for a single paper its a lot and my area has shorter papers). Could also apply product plot paper to another plot.

## 2023 August 24
#### General
- I set up separate Github repos for the confirmation report and the IEEEVIS poster since keeping everything on the website was becoming a problem (for space)
- I also moved my old idea posts since they aren't really relevant anymore, all the info is in the confirmation report, and they were taking up space.
- I am hosting the PhD meeting this week so that has taken up a bit of my time

#### IEEEVIS
- Was thinking of having a small quiz question after each section that was related to the info/figure to make the poster interactive when I'm not there.

#### AEMO
- I read Christoff email stuff and I see what they are doing but I feel like I have the same confusion as I do with the WA solar team.
- I feel like I want to ask the same thing I wanted to ask the solar forecasting people, which is "what are you using this for". The reason I wanted to talk to someone who actually uses this plot is because there seem to be two aspects to this job 1) monitering and 2) doing stuff when something that they are monitering says it should change. All these projects are providing information on what is being monitered and showing us dashboards with a huge number of plots and data but I sill have no idea what these things are used for. The only thing we have gotten from the solar group is that they need to keep the energy between two thresholds. If it something as simple as "when I think it is above this threshold on this one thing" then I don't see why these decisions need to be made by a human. I am sure they are more complicated than that but I don't know how.

#### BEX6510
- I have fallen behind in the unit and I need to focus on it for a few weeks so it doesn't get ahead of me. I want to just do the poster and this unit until I'm caught up. 
- I.e. once the poster is done I might want to skip the meeting until I've caught up.

#### Meetings (And AuDHD management)
- Meetings take a lot out of me (even if they are short) and a lot of the time if I have a meeting/event it stresses me out and that is basically all I can do that day. 
- I realised this because I have had a meeting almost every dat this week and even though a lot of them are short I have been too exhausted to do work outside those meetings.
- This is also why I asked if we could move the meeting to once every two weeks.
- I'm fine if we have a meeting when you guys have something to discuss (like last week), but a lot of the time having the meeting means I don't do work on Friday because I am mentally exhausted.

### Notes
- send email to Christoff asking the questions I have about the project

## 2023 August 10
#### IEEEVIS Poster
- The deadlines have been changed a little
  - The abstract is due August 15
  - A PDF of the poster is due August 31
  - The video still says it is due September 22 but it also says "needs to be submitted with the 2-page abstract" so I'm not sure what they want with that one.

## 2023 July 27
#### BEX6510
- Unit started this week so I will not be able to do as much research every week

#### AEMO meeting
- I think it went well
- Told to check out early 2017 load shedding in two states as a case study as well.
- Areil also suggested looking at something to do with forecasting in wind turbines, he said he mentioned it to Sarah a couple of months ago and she would know what he was talking about.

#### IEEEVIS Poster
- I understand the feedback but and not entirely sure how to action some of it 
  - I don't know how to add in extra uncertainty sources when the limit is so small (and I am not sure if I have read the uncertainty sources they are talking about)
  -  I couldn't figure out the formatting of the abstract before and I could not work out what I was doing wrong.
  
#### Notes
##### IEEE Vis
- important to point to taxonomies and note that expanded on literature review documenting existing work 
- If you cite one paper and the reader can go to that paper and find others you can get away with only citing that papers (like review papers)
- start with eye catching element (visible from a distance as a starting point), make it obvious the direction they are supposed to read the poster in
- think about what kind of discussions you want to have with people, what do you want people to ask you about or comment on and focus poster to hint in that direction. people can come up ask the weirdest things.
- Can provide supplementary material (can have detailled table that shows where you got these details from) & small example in paper and say made review of literatre and more complete in table
- we reveiwed x number of papers (see supplementary material)
##### AEMO
- ask rob "were you working with [christoff burgmire](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=_UG_SgUAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate) about forecasting wind turbines
- also [link](https://dblp.org/pid/22/3144.html)

## 2023 July 20
#### VYT
- I didn't get time to finish the video but I did submit it haha
- I can show you the version I submitted
- I want to finish it later so that I have a video I want to send to people, but it is not a priority at the moment

#### AEMO meeting
- My phone needed to be replaced (it short circuited on Sunday) and a friend from Queensland was visiting yesterday/today so I haven't had a chance to do this yet.
- Should I show the VYT submission? Could be a useful opportunity to use it haha.

#### Notes
- Show AEMO related plots (could sketch something)
- Check with Bonsoo (email) need lectures recorded, and preferably some readable version of the slides or a textbook or something.

## 2023 July 13
#### This week I have...
- Literally only worked on my VYT submission but I think it's really good
  - I only have a little bit of the animation left, then I just need to do the outlines and shading and I'm done.
  - I want to show you what I have so far and get some feedback
 
#### Notes
- multivariate before spatial-temporal
- energy, weather, time, space variables
- also convey gross vs nice teletubby with colour
- make frankenstein teletubby cute

## 2023 July 6
#### This week I have...
- Am halfway through my VYT submission that is due Monday
- Had the academic writing meeting and we both agreed that with a proof read for "formality" I can change my writing to be more formal if I need to
- Daily tasks: a brief read of 2 papers from the paper pile and summarising an experimental paper for the taxonomy (These will basically always be daily but I keep them here because they do take up an hour or 2 every day and don't produce anything for you guys to look at)


## 2023 June 29
#### This week I have...
- Submitted IEEE VIS paper
- Booked an academic writing session with a learning advisers for next Tuesday.
- Had AEMO meeting with control room operator
- Started compiling the method information from experimental papers (not available on site yet because I need to clean it up)
- Started VYT draft

#### Academic writing
- I read the library resources on academic writing and realised I do in-fact know how to do it, I just don't like writing that way. 
- Objective and passive voice are easy to implement, but a formal voice is a little more difficult to implement. I think I strugggle to tell the difference between formal writing and boring (dry) writing.
- Regardless, I did book the meeting with the academic writing person at the library to make sure I can fix it if I need to. 

#### AEMO
- I think it would be helpful if they had an operations guide or something.
- A debreif would be good. I was a little lost tbh.

#### Notes
- R pacakge weatheroz (didn't work very well)
- have to pull solar radiation infor from noaar package
- Sherry expert in pulling weather data, try talking to her

## 2023 June 22
#### Todo Things
- IEEE Vis
  - I haven't done the poster submission yet. I'm going to
- Confirmation Feedback Adjustments
  - I think a problem with my confirmation report is that I was responding to a bunch of papers that nobody has read. Organising the papers that compare plots into some kind of data set might help provide context for what I'm saying.
  - I have done a lot of examples of particular aspects of my idea but one example that captures the whole idea would probably be better
  - Map presentation questions back to each paper
  - I think these things would also help me iron out the idea work on it after I finish marking.
- AEMO meeting on Wednesday (hash out potential examples to help refine)
- VYT
- Check cassowaryr paper works with interp

#### Notes
- Confirmation questions
  - if you have the taxonomy, do you have an example of where it would help if you didn't have it
    - From what you have read so far an example where having that taxonomy would help you organise that material
  - is this a way to make better visualisations or improve/assess visualisations that already exist
  - Jess said use example from AEMO
  - not clear what problem I'm solving
  - lit review might be too broad and too hard to do
  - Less focus on Jessica Hullman's work
  - AEMO Example - what do they consider uncertainty, maybe not 5 estimated outcomes
  - Clean up rational of each question of presentation (innovative format to tackle) refine it
  - write down why we had each question (directly from papers) map back to each paper
  - run a wider study and doing it as a study (maybe funding from scholarship/prolifico - crowd sourced user study)
  - Talk to someone about confirmation report and what it means for writing to be more scientific (talk to person in library or IT faculty or ChatGPT (haha))

## 2023 June 1
#### Confirmation
- Wildly different from when I started. I expected as much which is why I didn't start for so long haha.

#### Presentation
- I added the presentation to the confirmation section
- Can I structure my confirmation as a game show? I think it would make it interesting and engaging for the audience. I did it once in 8th grade for a report and setting up the information as a precursor for quiz questions tried to ensure people

#### VYT
- I registered for the visualise your thesis competition. Deadline is mid-July. It will give me something fun to work on off the back of the the confirmation. I used to make educational stop motion youtube videos when I was a teenager haha.

## 2023 June 1

#### Confirmation Report
- Working on the draft right now, you can see my progress [here](https://harriet.quarto.pub/harriet-mason/ideas/#confirmation-report)
- I'll message the slack when its readable and the edits I am making are smaller, hopefully by Wednesday afternoon.

##### Report Questions
- I feel like I should include a HOPS plot but I'm not sure how since it's an animation. I could use a screenshot of the visualisation in the paper but I don't know how to replicate it in R.
- multiple labeled frames to highlight animation under figure 1
- Express marginal and conditional distributions using formal math $f(PPM|Solution=A)$ and $f(PPM|Solution=B)$

### NOTES
- Boostrapping = resampling w replacement - keep side same (calls it permutaiton typically take two groups and scramble lables (sampling from propulation with no difference not changing dist))
- Chapter 1 add: Need to prodive evidence this abstraction is better. Link to concrete analytical work - link back to a particular framework - study to show why that particular one.
- doesn't need empirical evidence but does need to be really well motivated why you want to go in that direction
- In process of applying for ethics and hopefully after confirmation (one for AEMO and one for experiment)  - discussion with them might be recorded - once recording info if want to put quote in thesis need ethics approval - Need better understanding of the problem we are focusing on
- expand on chapter three - make suggestions on what *could* be there - e.g. software for visualising uncertainty specifically for energy output - how this applies for different types of plots and package makes it easy to make those plots. - not just technical but other application areas (translation) - applications of the framework in the energy sector, doesnt just need to be technical outputs can be the work being used in energy and generalised. Show it is beneficial and useful.
- no justification for why an R package and why do it (integrated into data analysis workflow)
- need to make it clearer that scholarship is from AEMO. investement from them and a case study. 
- mention talking to aemo people (title of their group and names of people) - show in conversations - also publication they sent
- cassowaryr - link to energy data with masses of different time series - characterise of feature sets - variation and uncertainty - shows done more work (mention in topic 3 looking at technical outputs can be used for energy been working on package) - looking to see how they match and overlap (different time series from lots of sources and scales pending further investigation) (add to chapter 3 details how this would work and how it relates to energy data)
- connect to academics with questions at the begining (academics love a table of results with confidence intervals make it relatable to people on the comitee)
- above all else show the data - Edward tufte 
- enough information to answer a question relates to concept of sufficiency
- maybe make distributions not asusmed more clear
- change colour scheme
- Being sure is good; being uncertain is not necessarily bad. https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2530

## 2023 May 25
This has been a week of trying to fix endless technical issues :(

#### General
- I want to have the supervisor meeting every fortnight. Having it every week is stressful and I always feel like I haven't had enough time to properly work on what you guys told me to do in the last meeting before you present new stuff for me to do. This leaves me with 50 unfinished pieces of work and I just want more time to finish things.

#### Cassowaryr
- Writing up new issues and haven't been able to solve the tRiad problem. It might be because I messed around with stuff to get tensorflow working but idk. Current state is [here](triad/interpcheck.qmd)

#### Confirmation Report
- I started an outline and after a lot of struggling got it to output as a PDF [here](https://harriet.quarto.pub/harriet-mason/ideas/#confirmation-report)
- Should I make the confirmation report its own repo?
- Is there an existing template I should use?
- When do you guys want a draft of the report by?

#### Visualising uncertainty
- I have been organising the literature I've read on plots and most of it is just drawings in my notes app (so not on the blog). Thinking of working forwards from what Emi suggested last week so I have an idea of the overarching groups of plots and their related questions (using current research) 

### Notes
- https://ieeevis.org/year/2023/info/call-participation/posters (Poster submission after comfirmation report) - in Melbourne 
- Think about research outcomes of each section (and its research contributions) some technical and some theoretical and some use
- Reread original research motivation
- Draft of report by next week
- Confirmation report fine where it is but eventually need thesis repo
- Look at book Sarah suggested on how/why

## 2023 May 18
#### AEMO Meetings
- I emailed Dean and CCed all of you. He said he would set up a meeting.

#### Visualising uncertainty
- Part 3 [here](https://harriet.quarto.pub/ideas/parts/uncertaintyisdecisions/). It is very messy and unreadable and I'm currently trying to organise my ideas.


## 2023 May 11
#### AEMO Meetings
- Map of plan and draft email for AEMO people [here](aemo/aemoplan.qmd)
- Was I supposed to discuss this with Dean or was I supposed to make this and bring it to him?
 
#### cassowaryr
- I tried to install from CRAN and I ran into the same problem. 
- I genuinely have no idea what he is talking about with method 2. Have you guys done anything like that before? I read the stuff he provided and don't even know where to start.

### Notes
- task taxonomies

## 2023 May 4
#### Confirmation
- Should we try and organsise a top three dates? (If everyone is here). It looks like we won't be able to get a date with everyone that Catherine can chair.
- Skim read confirmation reports Di sent me. @Sarah if you have some you think would be helpful for me to read, I would also be keen to read those.
- It looks like the format goes: motivation/literature reivew, brief mentions of scope of 3 the three projects, detailled explanation of project 1 work to date, general discussion of plans for the other two projects, broad timeline of the phd.
- Since I have done an amount of cassowaryr work in the first year, should I detail that in the confirmation report even though its the third topic?
- Should I write it in the abbreviated report format? Is there a template for either of these I should use?

#### Visualising uncertainty
- Should I organise another meeting with Dean?
- Started applying taxonomy to example [here](https://harriet.quarto.pub/ideas/what_is_uncertainty/#applying-the-typology).

### Notes
#### WA AEMO meeting
- What do we want from them relative to my work
- How often should we meet
- What data are we working with
- Worthwile to map out what types of things we want to do with them before just jumping in
- Worthwhile to think of exploratory stage (if you have problems early on in your modelling and data processing - weather patterns which are pretty consistent) to be able to diagnose models (where do you not have sufficient information)
- Interested in workflow
- Split issues and EDA and communication perspective and map out what data would be related to each one. (could get sample or aggregate - want to keep geographical information in tact or disclosure agreement). 
- Could get access ourselves rather than waiting for them to give us access
- Look at AEMO data - seen this on your website, do you have a finer detail of data we could use.

#### Cassowaryr and Thesis
- How does cassowaryr link to entire thesis, is it related or is it a side research project that develops research skills
- Include if it can be linked to overarching ideas

## 2023 April 27
#### General
- Teaching ends up taking up a lot of time, especially in later weeks. I don't think I'll teach next semester.
- Github actions arent working and Github token has expired so meeting notes haven't been updating. Will fix before next week.
  
#### ASC
- Wrote poster abstract submission

#### Visualising uncertainty
- Had a meeting with Dean Sharafi, Toby Price and Alireza Fereidouni about the problems with uncertainty that AEMO is facing in WA. The meeting was recorded if you guys want to watch it. They asked if I wanted to work with them on their issue. Said I would go back to you guys and see what you think.
- I ironed out the definition/typology of uncertainty a little more [here](https://harriet.quarto.pub/ideas/what_is_uncertainty)

## 2023 April 20
#### Visualising uncertainty
- Started writing a mathematical definition of uncertainty in part 2 [here](https://harriet.quarto.pub/ideas/what_is_uncertainty/#defining-uncertainty). I am not sure how deep the mathematical definition should go. I was working through it with Tom and 

#### Cassowaryr
- Tried and failed to install interp usig gitlab. Emailled Albercht again. Haven't tried the new installing method that he emailled back


## 2023 April 6
#### General
- I have split the website in two. This website contains meetings notes, teaching help sheets, and written out research ideas. I have also changed the layout and structure.
- I moved blog posts and other public stuff to [netlify](https://harrietmason.netlify.app/). This fixes the size issue for the website and also draws a line between the blog posts and the research posts.

#### Last weeks meeting
- I have spoken to Di already and Ursula isn't here this week so it might not be beneficial to talk about it.
- If there is something you don't understand (or don't understand the whole thing) when I am presenting something I want you guys to tell me or ask about it. Otherwise I don't know what part is the problem and I don't know if the idea is bad or you just don't understand it. I got upset last week because the suggestions and the direction you guys thought I wanted to go with the research made it clear I didn't properly convey what I wanted to do, but the suggestions implied the idea was bad instead of implying a misunderstanding. That's why I was also upset when you suggested the work was good, since it was still clear I hadn't conveyed the idea and it wasn't persuasive.
- If I am going to the effort to explicity ask for something or make it clear its not possible, it is not really negotiable. There are a lot of research topics, so if I am aginst one thing that doesn't mean I am against everything. I am happy to make concessions in other areas, but often it takes a lot of effort for me to tell you guys that something is off the table so I need to it to be understood when I do. Otherwise I will just end up ignoring your advice because I already made it clear what I am and am not willing to do.
- I know there are four of you so you cant all stay updated on meeting notes, so I have tried to make the website more digestible so you can just read it to catch up.
- Also, since I start with an overview and work my way down, citations are the last thing I usually add to my writing. That means when I present a topic I will essentially never have citations. That does not mean I am not basing my work off evidence, it means I haven't done the citations yet.
- Please tell me if there is anything I can do to better communicate with you guys. I am happy to make changes to how I do things, but I don't know if nobody tells me anything.

#### Visualising uncertainty
- Rather than give piece by piece what I am trying to do, I have written up a motivation and outline of my idea [here](https://harriet.quarto.pub/ideas/) and will fill the sections with more detail as I go. Hopefully this will give you guys a better understanding of what I am trying to convey and why I don't want to work on spatial or temporal uncertainty specifically. In the overview I ended up just re-explaining the entire idea because I don't know which parts you guys are confused on so it might seem a little repetitive, sorry. I also included parts that I haven't written yet in the outline to give a better idea of where I want to go with the idea. If you don't understand parts please ask and I will focus on trying to explain that part better. If you fully get the idea and have criticism of it I'm open to hearing it. There are no citations, not because I don't have evidence to back up my claims, but because I typically do citations last. I can describe a paper that backs up each of my points from memory and send it to you if you want, so please don't say I have nothing to back up my claims when I present an overview like this.
- I have removed the intro bits from the posts. I was including them because starting with a diary entry helped me write about the research, but I think they make the posts longer and more difficult to read. I'm going to keep them in the public blog posts, but the private ones will just have the research information.

#### Notes
- write abstract for Australian Statistical Conference poster and show next week
 
## 2023 March 29
#### General
- The blog site is too big for quarto.pub which is why I had issues publishing my stuff this week :(. 
- I'm not sure if I should move the whole thing somewhere else, or just move the blog.

#### CassowaryR
- I haven't tried the GitLab link from Albrecht yet. I will do that soon.

#### Uncertainty Visualisation
- I did a manic word vomit about visualising uncertainty and my issues with it, its in the blog posts section but you can just use this [link](https://harriet.quarto.pub/posts/uncertaintyisdecisions/).
- I think I am leaning towards making a guide or something on how to visualise uncertainty based on the decision you want to make, not based on the type of data? Similar to the rules we have for normal visualisation? IDK.

#### Comments
- I need to establish ground rules for the next meetings.
- I don't want to do work that will turn out to be obsolete with other work. You keep asking me to zoom in but what if what I wan't to do as my first topic is establish rules for uncertainty visualisation the way we have rules for other visualisation.

## 2023 March 23
#### CassowaryR
- I can't even install the newer version of the package. I have tried using a couple methods and none of them worked.
- Should I email back and say I can't install the package?

#### General
- I think I want to change the direction of my topic a little bit, interesting in everyone's thoughts.

#### Comments
- Sarah is contacting people that I can talk to from AEMO and I should contact Sayani so that I can better understand what their problems are.

## 2023 March 16
#### General
- I added Sarah as a supervisor
- My github actions broke for a bit so my meeting notes weren't updating.

#### Milestone
- I got the reminder email that my milestone is due in 2 months
- I am still not entirely sure what I have to do for it

#### Uncertainty Literature Review
- Have enough reading to start filling out the uncertainty breakdown blog post, found [here](https://harriet.quarto.pub/posts/what_is_uncertainty/).
- Currently adding stuff as we speak

#### CassowaryR
- I have read Alberts email but I haven't checked the new version of interp. I will do that before emailing him back, hopefully before next week.
- He suggested adding random noise, for the long computation issue. The delauney triangulation SHOULD work with colinear points and considering the striated scagnostic literally counts the number of points in a straight line, I am not the biggest fan of that solution. Cassowaryr also already includes jitter for perfectly colinear points (i.e. the straight lines) and while the code runs without error I feel like it opens up some new issues. It means the MST and the hulls the scagnostic are calculated on are not the ones the user sees, and we have already seen that small changes to the triangulation can throw those quite off balance. Plus it now makes it invisible to cassowaryr if points are in a perfectly straight line, and I don't wan't that to be invisible.
- Additionally, if we intend to use cassowaryr for projection persuit where we aren't unitizing the projection every time we calculate the scagnostics, a set amount of random noise will have more effect on some projections than others. 
- He also didn't mention the readability of the C package, nor the scatter plot that had an error, but I will double check those too.
- He showed the different plots for a larger N, which we already knew interp was faster. This might be why he is not keep on swapping packages (excluding the extra work). I wonder if he would be willing to include tRiad as an option (although he might not go for it because it increases his dependencies).

#### Meetings comments and notes
- Additional issue with adding noise in the interp function. Once we add binning to the package and start implementing it, we dont want to be adding noise afterwards. It's a bit weird.
- Can try writing an intermediate function to take the tRiad output and make it look like the interp::tri.mesh() output so tRiad can be seamlessly integrated. 
- Some terms in the uncertainty are a bit odd. Maybe I should write a glossary.
- The forecast display does not make it clear the uncertainty in the model if determined by the residuals of the fitted values. Interesting to see if displaying the fitted values on the forecast makes people see more vs less uncertainty. 


## 2023 March 9

#### General
* Set up github actions so the meeting notes are always up to date.

#### Uncertainty Literature Review
- Just read papers this week, didn't write anything new.

#### CassowaryR
- I fixed the github actions issue, the github actions themselves needed to be updated, it was nothing wrong with the dependencies or code.
- I wrote out a motivation that could be sent to the author of alphahull as to why the swap from interp to tRiad is necessary. It can be found [here](triad/triadswap.qmd)

## 2023 March 2
  
#### General
- I made this website to store information and posts and stuff. It keeps everything together which I like.
  
#### Uncertainty Literature Review
- Finished writing the first blog post and published on this website under [posts](https://harriet.quarto.pub/posts/)
  
#### Experiemnts
- Made a list of [experiment ideas](https://harriet.quarto.pub/research/ideas.html) from the "why people don't visualise uncertainty" topic which is on the website. 
- Added some other experiment ideas for future sections (although I haven't read that much literature on the topics so I am not sure if they are good ideas or not)
  
#### CassowaryR
- Made the hex sticker and added it to the [repo](https://github.com/numbats/cassowaryr) (finally)
- The build and stuff work locally on my computer, but fail in the github actions. They all have the same error and I don't know what it means.
  
#### Meetings comments and notes
- To test if people are more likely to visualise uncertainty if it is set as a default, make two packages for people to visualise uncertainty. One where the default is uncertainty and one where it isn't and see if people just leave the default or if they don't like the uncertainty so much they change it. Would need to do some finessing so it is not obvious it is Robs package.
- To test if including uncertainty is the best way to show the differentiation between the data and the forecast compare uncertainty to other methods of differentiating the forecast. Other methods such as a gap, a change in the line colour, or a change in background colour.
- People are often presented with risk as odds relative to the average (e.g. your area has 3x more cancer cases than the average). Could be good to test this method of conveying odds relative to a population level (60 people in your area of 10 000 have cancer and the average is 20 per 10 000).
- To test the cognative overload of uncertainty, we can show different designs and see how long it takes to answer a question on it. Alternatively we can fix the time and see which plot gives people the most accuracy. Try to find a motivating example. If we want to compare it to not visualising at all and just displaying threshold values, create a ladder of choices or categories, however in general it is hard to quantify continuous uncertainty.
- Energy data may be a good motivating example for the fan vs paths display of forecasting uncertainty. Di emailled it as an RDS.
