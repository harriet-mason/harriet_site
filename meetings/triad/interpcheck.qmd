# Does the paper run?
- Yes.
- I had issues with RJ tools or soemthing back in the honours year, so there might be formatting issues but otherwise it seems fine and there are no errors.

# Do we ned to update any of the results in the paper? 
- No.
- I am not sure how big the jitter is but it does not seem to be large enough to have changed any of the results discussed in the paper.
- Obviously we should do a read over and update the cassowaryr R version so that it requires the newest version of interp.

# Could there be future issues with this interp solution and cassowaryr?
- Yes.
- Once we add binning to the package and start implementing it, we probably don't want to add noise afterwards. It is possible however that this won't be a problem and the binning itself will remove the need for jitter at the interp stage.
- While the jitter is small, it could be a problem if it isn't scaled according to the size. When used on static scatter plots this doesnt matter because it is unitised, but if we intend to use cassowaryr for projection persuit where we aren’t unitizing the projection every time we calculate the scagnostics, a set amount of random noise will have more effect on some projections than others. 
- The other problem with the jitter being added at the interp level is the draw() functions are going to be slightly off. Cassowaryr already adds in a little bit of jitter if the points are in a straight line, but that jitter appears in the draw functions (so the user could see if it was having an impact if they got some weird results). We have already seen that small changes to the triangulation can throw those quite off balance and this could make checking strange results a bit of a nightmare. 
- Albrecht also didn’t mention the readability of the C package in his email. I guess we are just ignoring that...

# Emailling Albrecht
- I will email Albrecht to let him know it is all g.
- I don't think it is worth mentioning the binning thing right now unless you guys think I should.
